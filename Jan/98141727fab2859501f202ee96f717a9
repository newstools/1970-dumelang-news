The MEC for Finance in the Free State, Elzabe Rockman, tabled the budget vote which she said as one of the priorities set out to decrease poverty and deprivation. During her speech on Tuesday at Gariep Dam she said the National treasury had allocated Free State R105 billion over the 2017 Medium Term Expenditure Framework which is divided into R32.901 billion in 2017/18, R35.104 billion in 2018/19 and R37.615 billion in 2019/20. Rockman said the Free State budget for the year 2017/18 has been broken down into three parts, R24.522 billion which is an equitable share, R7.267 billion which is conditional grants and R1.112 billion which is the Free State revenue. Rockman mentioned that global growth was the weakest since 2009. It s on this back drop where the mountainous climb for any emerging market economy becomes daunting. Some good news for the Province was the number of tourists increased significantly from 2.1 million in 2010 to 6.4 million in 2014. This was very impressive especially for the tourism authority s efforts. Rockman s speech was peppered with African proverbs in trying to show the emphasis on the cuts that the treasury was going to implement. An ant on his feet can do more than an elephant lying down, said Rockman. Economic Growth rate The Free State economy is estimated to have contracted by 0.7 percent in 2016, after growing by 0.4 percent in 2015. The negative growth rate of the provincial economy is primarily informed by the following factors: Marginal growth in the government and community services sector. Stagnated manufacturing; as well as declining output and low prices for commodities coming from our province; The slowdown in the agriculture sector mainly as a result of drought. The provincial economy is projected to grow by 1.1 percent on average over the next four years, reaching a high of 1.8 percent in 2020. Provincial economic interventions Significant investments in the green economy, including the development of the Xhariep Solar Park in Bethulie and a solar park in the Matjhabeng municipality The Maluti-A-Phofung Special Economic Zone has completed infrastructure work to date of R212m with more being planned with Department of Trade and Industry s initial funding commitment in excess of R800 million One of our stated priorities is the development of infrastructure in the most remote and underdeveloped rural areas. Eg former homeland areas of QwaQwa and Bophuthatswana Infrastructure development and maintenance through continuation of existing as well as new projects in QwaQwa, Thaba Nchu and Botshabelo will amount to approximately R1.5 billion over the 2017 Medium Term Expenditure Framework Public Procurement We are particularly pleased that the revised Preferential Procurement Regulations were gazetted during January 2017. This revision was largely influenced by the need to provide for a mechanism to empower certain categories Small, Medium and Micro Enterprises (SMMEs), co-operatives, township and rural enterprises - through procurement. Specific set-asides for youth and women will be accommodated through these measures.
