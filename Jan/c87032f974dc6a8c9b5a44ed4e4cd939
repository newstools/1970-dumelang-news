The Tshwane Metro Police says permission for a march organised by civil society groups scheduled for Friday has not yet been granted. Civil groups and Trade unions have been camping at Pretoria Church Square since the beginning of the week to voice their grievances, following President Jacob Zuma's cabinet reshuffle. The march, which is expected to attract thousands of people, is intended to force Zuma to step down as President. Tshwane Metro Police spokesperson Isaac Mahamba says they are still waiting for pending papers from the March organisers before they can grant permission. Yes we can confirm that at this stage Tshwane Metro Police Department did not approve any march. We had a meeting with SACP and SaveSA organisations, there are some documents that were still outstanding and we can confirm that they were committed to submitting those documents by today. At this stage we are safe to announce that their application is still pending subjected to the submission of those documents. Meanwhile, motorists are advised to avoid the Johannesburg CBD between 10am and 2pm Friday due to a march by members of the Democratic Alliance (DA). The march is part of the DA's programme of action to call for President Jacob Zuma to resign. Several roads in and around the CBD will be closed to traffic.
