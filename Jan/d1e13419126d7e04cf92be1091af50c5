In line with its 10 year Celebrations and using its money expertise to do good while investing in the passion of its client, Nedbank has made a ground-breaking announcement. For the first time in the history of the cup, Nedbank have purchased 10 000 tickets from the PSL for the final which will be sold exclusively to Nedbank clients for only R10 a ticket. The highly anticipated 2017 edition of the tournament is officially set to conclude on Monday (24 June, 2017). Nedbank s Executive Head for Retail and Business Banking Marketing, Vanessa Singh, said the R10 ticket price has been a long-term aspiration since the inception of the Nedbank Cup. Singh is also grateful to the PSL for their understanding and making this possible for Nedbank clients. This is our way of thanking Nedbank clients for their support over the years, not only support for the bank, but also support for the Nedbank Cup which has really invigorated the Nedbank brand. As money experts who do good, it s only right that we use our money expertise to invest in the passion of our clients. The R10 ticket is a token of our appreciation, said Singh. The Nedbank Cup quarterfinals provide the remaining eight sides in the competition with a chance to take one step closer to the R7-million prize-money and to write their names into South African football folklore. There is also the added attraction of representing the country in the CAF Confederation Cup for the winning team.
