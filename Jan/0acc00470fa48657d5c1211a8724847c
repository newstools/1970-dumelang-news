Samuel Molefe (32) from Phuthaditjhaba in QwaQwa is making a mark in the Hip-hop show-business despite his disability. Molefe who is known in the Hip Hop world as Big Money is working on his forthcoming album after the lukewarm reception of his derby album Madibuseng which had songs such as Haba Sake , Ney Ney, and Phush indayo which made him a well known figure in QwaQwa. He said he grew up listening to Kwaito and Hip Hop and was greatly influenced by the late Kwaito King Mandoza. Big Money said he got a car accident in 2005 which almost killed him but by the grace of God, he survived and decided to follow his passion of rapping so as to tell his story and ambitions. He was left paralyzed from the waist to his legs. I started entering rap battles at school against my friends while I was about 15 years. I love music so much that I listen it all the time. I feel like it is part of my blood coursing through out my body, said Big Money. He said he was working on his upcoming album which he hopes to drop in July later this year. Big Money said he was going to cause the stir in the music business with his lyrical ability.
