Though visually impaired as a result of his albinism, Lekunutu Moloi, from Riverside in Qwaqwa uses his pencil to create magic within the portraits he draws for his clientele ranging from ordinary people on the street to celebrity personalities. This self-taught artist has created timeless pictures showcasing the beautiful landscape of Qwaqwa in its mountainous regions and a number of portraits on local heroes. Being unemployed, his drawings is the only way for him to put bread on the table. Moloi has drawn the likes of Mayor Vusi Tshabalala, Seipati Seoke, Nkunyana Nkunyana, MEC Tate Makgoe, Ba2Cada, Premier Ace Magashule and President Jacob Zuma to mention just the few. His community knows his work well and have sent some off to those in authority hoping to get a breakthrough. His pencil and paper sheets are what motivates him. He draws from photographs and also real life. "My short term goal is to get bursary to study Visual Arts at the nearest TVET which will help me to master my craft and to learn more. One of my dreams is to have a space of my own like a gallery where I will also be able to transfer my skills to the up-coming artists. There are a lot of talented artists like myself in the townships and we all need exposure and educational assistance to make it as artists," said Moloi. He first picked up the pencil after being encouraged by his neighbour, Zakhali Monamodi who has instilled the love of art in him from an early age. Since then he has gone to public spaces whenever there are sessions to showcase his talent. Fellow artists like poets and musicians are very receptive of his works. Moloi explained that art needs time to be perfected and mastered properly. Currently, he is growing his networks and building a market for his artworks.
