Toyota Cheetahs are confident they will retain their Super Rugby status for next year despite reports continuing to suggest they are one of two South African teams confirmed to be on the way out of the tournament. While many fingers continue to point to the Cheetahs and the Southern Kings, the decision is yet to be made. There s a substantial process that still needs to be followed before a final decision can be taken. SA Rugby said that it hoped it would be able to confirm its 2018 Super Rugby participants by the end of June 2017. These are challenging and uncertain times for all the Super Rugby franchises in SA. The Cheetahs are 100 percent committed to the process and we strongly believe that through an honest and fair process we stand a strong chance of retaining our Super Rugby status. SA Rugby has started with the internal consultations process to identify its four entrants to the 2018 competition.
