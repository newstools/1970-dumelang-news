The government of Lesotho has launched a campaign to localise its Textile manufacturing industry that produces 100 million garments a year but remains dominated by foreign owned firms. Minister of Trade and Industry Joshua Setipa promises subsidised factory shells and lines of credit to Basotho. The Textile sector is the highest private sector employer in Lesotho, with more than 40 000 workers. Foreign investors have taken advantage of preferential Trade regimes like the United States AGOA. Now the Ministry of trade is rolling up its sleeves to provide subsidised factory shells and credit lines for local manufacturers. Setipa says, "We are looking at long term sustainability. So as long as the industry is in the hands of investors that take a medium term view who after 10 years will decide to pack and go to Cambodia we will never be able to achieve the sustainability we want." Afri Expo is a small business which has been operating for six months, producing for major retailers like Woolworths in South Africa.
