Water and Sanitation minister, Nomvula Mokonyane, said water challenges in Qwaqwa are worsened by recent droughts, high water losses, aging infrastructure and water systems not interlinked in the area. Mokonyane visited Maluti a Phofung municipality on Tuesday, following water challenges gripping the community of Qwaqwa. For more than two years, locals followed long queues to get drinkable water from water tankers administered by the municipality.Following recent rains and rise in dam levels along the integrated Vaal River system, the minister met with the local and district municipalities as well as representatives of the provincial government of the Free State. Mokonyane also engaged with civic, business and agricultural sector organisations to further expand on the water situation in the area.The minister said the municipality must have a water and sanitation master plan which should be in line with the National Development Plan 2030. There s need for optimal use of the water treatment works, she said. In January 2016, the Ministry of Water and Sanitation contributed four additional water tankers to Maluti-a-Phofung municipality after the Fika Patso dam dried up following the severe drought. The municipality is currently working on finding long team solution, however, it is not yet clear when residents will start accessing water from their taps. The Department of Water and Sanitation spokesperson, Sputnik Ratau, said recent rains have provided a bit of relief but the water crisis has not yet been averted in certain parts of the Free State.According to the spokesperson, the Fika Patso dam levels is currently at 42.9 percent as opposed to 13.5 percent that it was during this time last year. Free State dam levels are at an average of 81.9 percent compared to 53.9 percent in March 2016. The province is currently experiencing episodes of heavy rainfall with the average dam levels rising by a staggering 17.5 percent in the past week.
