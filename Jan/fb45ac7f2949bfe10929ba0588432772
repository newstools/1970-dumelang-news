Boko Haram has released 21 of more than 200 girls kidnapped by Boko Haram Islamists in 2014 in the northern town of Chibok, the Nigerian government said on Thursday. "The release of the girls is the outcome of negotiations between the administration and theBoko Haram brokered by the International Red Cross and the Swiss government," a presidency statement said. "The negotiations will continue."Around 270 girls were taken from their school in Chibok in April 2014. Dozens escaped in the initial melee, but more than 200 are still missing. The kidnapping triggered worldwide outrage promoted by a twitter hash tag #bringbackourgirls. The presidency gave no details on the deal, saying only that the 21 girls were very tired and would first rest in the custody of the national security agency. Afterwards the girls would be handed over to Vice President Yemi Obinsajo, the statement said. President Muhammad Buhari will travel to Germany on Thursday. Authorities said in May that one of the missing girls had been found and President Muhammadu Buhari vowed to rescue the others. Boko Haram's seven-year insurgency to create an Islamic state in the northeast has led to the deaths of 15,000 people and displaced more than two million
