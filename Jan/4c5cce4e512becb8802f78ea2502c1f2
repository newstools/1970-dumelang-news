BLOEMFONTEIN - The Xhariep district will soon have a sixth eye care unit opened at Albert Nzula Hospital in Trompsburg. This was revealed by newly-appointed Free State MEC for Health, Butana Komphela, in his speech during the commemoration of World Sight Day (WSD) on Thursday 13 October at National Hospital in Bloemfontein where over 150 cataract removal operations are expected to be conducted throughout the week. I want to ensure that by the time we open that hospital, the eye care unit is allocated space to do their work and Free State has less than 5 percent blind people, said the MEC.Komphela said that the province would be able to cover the 1800 backlog by the end of the year if all centres intensify. Once all the numbers are in of which centres has the largest backlog, we will have to focus all our resources there to ensure that we eradicate the backlog there, he said. According to the Eye Care Coordinator in the Premier s Office, Fikile Mphulenyane, there is a backlog of about 1800 cataract operations in the province which needs to be covered. Today alone, all five eye care centres in the province are also conducting their own operations in commemoration of the day, she said. She further explained that the exact numbers of how many operations were conducted would be calculated the following day. National Hospital is the mother-centre for such operations as it caters for all districts mainly Xhariep, which currently doesn t have an eye care centre, she said. The head of the Eye Care Unit at Universitas Academic Hospital, Professor Wayne Marais, said that according to the 2015 World Health Organisation (WHO) statistics, 285 million people are visually impaired in the world and 80 percent of them are over the age of 50 years.
