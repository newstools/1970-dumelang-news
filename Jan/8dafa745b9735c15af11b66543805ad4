I was told that the woman had been killed because she lived openly as a lesbian. No one deserves to be killed because she has chosen a different lifestyle or was born different. God loves us all and we serve an almighty God at our church and we don t judge anyone, said Rev Ramoroa. He said he was saddened by the death of the woman and wondered why the body was dumped near his church.
