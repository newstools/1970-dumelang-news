Local artists have paid heartfelt tributes to veteran artist Joe Mafela who died in a car crash last weekend in Johannesburg. At the time of his death, 75-year-old Mafela was part of the cast of SABC soapie 'Generations, The Legacy'. Speaking at Mafela's memorial service at the Mandela Theatre in Johannesburg, the soapie's executive producer Mfundi Vundla says the soapie's studio will be named after Mafela. 5"He built the SABC. He brought audiences to the SABC. Joe and I at the company in Generations we were working at a studio called studio 5. And studio 5 must be called the Joe Mafela studio." Tributes continue to pour Mafela at his memorial service in Johannesburg's Mandela Theatre. The service is being attended by family members, friends, colleagues and fans. Mafela died in a car crash in Johannesburg last weekend. Speaking at the service, SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago says Mafela's life should be celebrated. "We must start differentiating between somebody being known and somebody being celebrated." "In this particular instance we're celebrating a life. What a humble man. And for us as the SABC we are grateful to have crossed paths with him."
