When two local music maestros, Castino and his old friend Thwenny, recently joined forces, the two discovered that together they have what it takes, to take over the showbiz world. Twenty-three-year-old Castino from Rocklands first made a name for himself with the hit single Keng ka wena and from there he hooked up with Thwenny to work on a mixtape entitled Stino le Thwenny ba kae? which has 10 tracks such as 'Call', 'Waiting', 'Power House Crew', 'Charlie', 'Merchandise' and 'Thebe'. Castino said he realised that he had a style that was similar to Thwenny when he was starting out as a rap artist. Thwenny raps in Sesotho. The duo said that the fans had then asked them to work together because they had similar style and they listened. Castino said their style of music was New Age Hip Hop as they are influenced greatly by kwaito music of Thebe and TKZee, and also the genres with Kanye West and Snoop Dogg amongst others. I used to rap alone in Sesotho and Thwenny used to do the same thing but our fans asked us to collaborate to see what we could produce. We went into the studio four years ago and we have never looked back because the fans like us even more, said Castino. He said they wanted to create a loyal following in Bloemfontein before they could hit Johannesburg to claim their spot in the competitive town. Castino said they loved entertaining the people as music was their life and could not imagine doing anything other than music. He said during the day they ran a multimedia company that did advertising, branding, music production and events promotion. Castino said he appreciated the love they got from the Bloemfontein masses as they often sing and dance along to their songs.
