The death of a 10-year-old boy from Mokudumela location this past weekend has left the Clocolan community shattered and in a state of mourning. The young child known as Kananelo Salemane fell into a manhole while playing with a kite. According to the mother of the boy, she was told that her son was walking backwards while playing with a kite and tragically fell into the uncovered manhole in Mokudumela. Tshokolo Sejane (39), a mother to two other children as well, said she was heartbroken to have lost her second born child who had so many dreams to achieve.She said her son was the center of her life. "Kananelo was a clever pupil at school. He did every well at school even though I was a struggling single mother," she said. She added that her son wanted to follow in the footsteps of his father to become a Security Guard because he liked the uniform and the handcuffs that he saw his father carrying. I m very heartbroken and don t know what to say because I lost my child, a light of my life. What is sad is that his father passed away in 2015 while on duty. I had just gone to visit my sister at my parent s homestead and when I returned my neighbour told me that my son had fallen into a manhole, said Tshokolo.She said she did not know how she was going to bury her son because of a lack of funds. Tshokolo said the Setsoto Municipality should have closed the manhole before something bad could happen. ER24 paramedic s spokesman Russel Meiring said when the paramedics arrived at the scene, they lifted up the body of the boy but he was declared dead at the scene.
