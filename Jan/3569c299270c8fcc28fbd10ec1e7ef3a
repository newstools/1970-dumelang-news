Britons will decide the future of their country and Europe after voting on Thursday in a vote on European Union membership after a bitter campaign that appeared to divide the nation down the middle. Prime Minister David Cameron called the referendum under pressure from his ruling Conservative Party and an increasingly powerful anti-EU party, hoping to put to rest decades of debate over Britain's place in Europe and its ties with Brussels. Most opinion polls put the "Leave" and "Remain" camps neck-and-neck at the end of a campaign that was dominated by immigration and the economy and shaken by the murder of a pro-EUMP, though late on Wednesday two showed a swing to "Remain". The "Leave" campaign says Britain's economy would benefit from a Brexit, or British exit. Cameron says it would cause financial chaos. Group of Seven finance leaders will issue a statement stressing their readiness to take all necessary steps to calm markets if Britain votes to exit the European Union, government officials with direct knowledge of the preparations said on Thursday. The referendum asks: "Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?" Commentators suggest Brexit could trigger a constitutional crisis in Britain, prompting another Scottish independence referendum and raising tensions in Northern Ireland, where the prospect of a hard border with the Irish Republic has been mooted. There are also fears it could prompt other EU countries, disillusioned with how Brussels has handed the eurozone and migrant crises, to try to break away. Polls close at 2100 GMT and, while early indications of results could come from around 0200 GMT Friday, the final declaration is not likely until around 0800 GMT. The hashtag "iVoted" was trending on Twitter
