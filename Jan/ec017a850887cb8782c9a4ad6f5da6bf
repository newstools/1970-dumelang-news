 A sensational knock from Steve Smith ensured the Rising Pune Supergiant kicked off their campaign with a seven-wicket victory by chasing down the Mumbai Indian s score of 184 with a ball to spare in the second match of the 2017 Indian Premier League played at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Pune. Smith s 84 from 54 balls, including seven fours and three sixes, was a lesson in batsmanship as he struck the ball to all parts of the ground. His ability to get into a position to pull the ball no matter where it lands defies logic at times and proved too much for the visiting bowlers. Imran Tahir was the standout performer in the first innings. He was tossed the ball earlier than either he or his captain Smith would have anticipated after a brisk start by Jos Butler (38 from 19) and Parthiv Patel (19 from 14). In the space of 10 balls, he ripped through the Indians top order. On Friday the action moves to Rajkot, where the Gujarat Lions will host the Kolkata Knight Riders at 16H30 SA time.
