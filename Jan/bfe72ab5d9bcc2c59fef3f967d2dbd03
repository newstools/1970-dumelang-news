Brutal Fruit Netball Premier League takes centre stage this weekend and the local side, the Free State Crinums, get their campaign underway on Sunday against the Gauteng Jaguars at the Durban University of Technology. The fourth edition of the league will yet again be contested by ten teams, with each team facing one another over six weekends and the play-offs taking place on the last two weekends. Each province has one team, except Gauteng, who has two. While some teams will look to improve from their last year s performance, the defending champions, the Crinums will look to continue where they left off, but will have to do so without their star players. They come into this season without the services of Protea's Karla Mostert and Lauren-Lee Christian, with the former the Player of the Series in 2015 playing in Australia and the latter in having moved to the East London s Aloes. The opening round promises to be an intense one, with teams already targeting positive results as soon as possible as the league comes with a major bonus for the winning team. Apart from the bragging rights as the country s best netball province, the winning team will head off to New Zealand to compete in their national championship later this year, with all expenses paid. The tournament starts with the first round of the league matches from April 21 to April 23 at the Durban University of Technology. The next weekend (28-30 April), the action moves back to Durban then to Cape Town in May at the Belhar Indoor Sport Centre. Then the City of Roses will host the action at the end of the month and the opening two weeks of June.
