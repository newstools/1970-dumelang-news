The six farmers accused of beating to death two black farm workers in Parys have pleaded not guilty. They were charged with murder and assault after the murders in January. After several false starts the trial finally got underway with the six accused pleading not guilty. The picture that has been painted with the prosecution reading that the evidence is that this was an unprovoked attack that was brutal. Some of the injuries reported by the eye witnesses that were there is that the two deceased sustained injuries on their heads, necks and chests and the injuries were so severe that both eventually died as a result. Sergeant Gerhudus Kaizer was one of the first police officers to arrive at the scene. He described how the two victims were badly beaten with sticks and the gun. Kaizer testified that the mob of white farm owners surrounded the injured men and poured water on them. Tensions are now high in this restive farming district as racism has been a hallmark here for decades. Steve Naale, spokesperson of Ngwathe Municipality said over the years we have seen a number of racially charged incidents in this area, even though they were not recorded, but in a nut shell we have also seen unhappiness from the farm workers complaining about not being remunerated properly, evicted from the farms and complaining about the physical abuse they get. The trial resumes this morning.
