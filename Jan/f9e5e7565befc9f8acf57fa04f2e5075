The Acting Head of Department in the Department of economic, small business development, tourism and environmental affairs (destea) Gadija Brown, when presenting the appointment letters to consumer affairs court officials said consumers needed to be protected from big businesses. The presentation of the letters to the officials was supposed to be done by MEC Benny Malakoane but something came up not allowing him to officiate at the ceremony. Brown apologized on his behalf and the presentation was done an hour later.She said the appointment of five men and five women was done deliberately to achieve a 50/50 representation. The consumer protection court would be situated at St. Andrews so that it could be close to the consumers to deal with their matters. It is comprised of 10 people who are very qualified in their fields such as law and business. South African laws are remarkable in protecting the individuals against multinationals, said Brown. She said the official swearing in of the officials will be held in Kroonstad next week Tuesday. Brown said a consumer would have to bring in a receipt slip of the items she/ he bought to the office so that the matter could be resolved. Brown said it was high time that retailers and other service offering businesses respected the rights of the consumers.The Consumer protection court is made up of Chairman NM Bahlekazi, Professor Rita Marie Johnson, Ben J Kgooe, DP Haggett, A Lechwano, TD Segoe-Backward, SB Lockman, CJ Bredenkamp and D Moeti.Acting Deputy Director General Dr. Mbulelo Nokwequ congratulated the officials on their appointment and wished them luck.
