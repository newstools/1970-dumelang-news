The Minister of Finance, Malusi Gigaba, says there will be no deviation from the Public Finance Management Act at a time when nuclear energy is procured. There have been concerns about the country's ability to afford the nuclear build programme. Gigaba was addressing investors as well as stakeholders on Wednesday at the Development Bank of Southern Africa in Midrand. He assured them that government will continue working towards ensuring that inclusive growth is achieved. Gigaba also reiterated that he will continue on the path of fiscal consolidation as was the case when Pravin Gordhan was leading the treasury. Since he assumed his new role as the Minister of Finance, Gigaba has been meeting with Chief Executive Officers of banks and ratings agencies and different stakeholders. The minister plans to visit international investors following the country's downgrade to sub investment status by two ratings agencies.
