The Deputy President of South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa allayed fears in parliament on Wednesday regarding the Sassa (South African Social Security Agency) debacle. He said more than 17 million recipients would get their social grants at the beginning of April like they used to. Ramaphosa said the plans were in place to ensure that there was no hiccup in disbursing the grants to many children, old people and people living with disabilities. The contract between Sassa and CPS (Cash Paymaster Services) is terminating at the end of March and Sassa had approached the constitutional court to decide on the continuation of CPS until another contractor was in place. However, Sassa withdrew the case which it intended to request the Constitutional court to intervene on Wednesday.Ramaphosa assured parliament that plans were in place to disburse the grants to 17 million beneficiaries. One of the really good things about our democracy is that it allows us to be able to raise matters of national interest like you are. In doing so, we should also be willing to listen precisely to steps that are being taken. The Armageddon that you are talking about will be avoided. We are going to make sure that the wheels don t come off , said Ramaphosa Madala Sox Moroka, 75, from Phahameng in Mangaung said he was worried when he heard that there possibilities that he was not going to get his old age grant. I heard over the radio that Sassa s contract with CPS was coming to an end in March and our money was not going to be paid. I was so worried because I was not going to be able to buy food for my grandchildren, said Moroka. He went on to say, he was relieved that he was going to get his pension in April and buy paraffin for winter as it would still be cheap.
