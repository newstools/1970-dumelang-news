Robert and the minister were convinced into talking about their differences during a 'sit down' set up by music veteran Oskido, who is a personal friend to both of them. Speaking to TshisaLIVE, Oskido confirmed that Robert and Fikile met on Monday night, and resolved "They are both my best friends and I decided to call them for a meeting and they agreed so everything went well. So Fikile and Marawa (Robert) are buddies, no more fighting," Oskido said. Oskido also shared a picture of the police minister and Robert shaking hands. "Conflicts and fights are a result of a failure to sit down and talk. This often leads to undesirable drama. It's good to see two people I hold highly, @robert_marawa and Minister of Police, hug and make up after talking," Oskido said in his caption.
