Toyota Stadium will be filled with excitement this weekend when the Cheetahs host the Zebre in their first ever home match of the Guinness Pro14 Rugby Championship. The Cheetahs, fresh from their Ireland tour, host the Italian side on Saturday evening, hoping for not only their first win of the competition, but redemption as well following defeats in their last two matches. The men from Bloemfontein have already lost to Ulster (42-19) in their opening and recently to Munster (51-18), and are eager to turning their fortunes around on home soil. In order to ensure the fans get behind the team, the Cheetahs have decided the entrance will be free, thanks to their title sponsor Toyota. However, fans still need a physical ticket to gain access to the stadium. Tickets can be collected at ticket office at the stadium, at Toyota dealerships of online at www.fscheetahs.co.za. Kickoff is at 19:30.
