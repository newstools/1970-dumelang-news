The Young Entrepreneurs Conference and Expo (YECE) is happening again at President Hotel in Bloemfontein, from June 1 to June 2 this year. This annual event is to be in its fifth year running. Registration is open and young entrepreneurs are invited to register for free. Chief event organiser and founder of YECE, Matefo Morakeng, encouraged the youth to attend. This year we will be celebrating five years of the event as well as the progress made by young entrepreneurs. We want to celebrate every young entrepreneur in the Free State province whether they have attended the event previously or not, he said. "We will also be celebrating the partnerships we have had that have enabled this platform to grow and become one of the sought after platforms in the province. Our partners and sponsors have been with us since the beginning, which is why for this year, we have added some new items which we think attendees will definitely like, he added. He further said: "We will be joined by various enterprise support institutions such as Seda Free State which has been there with us, supporting us from the first edition. The event will be officially opened at the breakfast function on Day One and ends with a gala dinner on Day Two. In between, there will be sessions that include business talks, master classes and funding discussion by experts in these fields. As usual, there will also be an exhibition showcasing products and services provided by young entrepreneurs. We encourage young entrepreneurs to register for this event and join us as it brings together other youth who connect with one another as well as with stakeholders in the youth entrepreneurship sphere, concluded Morakeng.
