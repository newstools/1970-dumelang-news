The Executive Mayor of Ngwathe Local Municipality, Cllr Joey Mochela, has commemorated the National Freedom Day with the youth of Ngwathe, by hosting a spectacular sports event. Mayor Mochela said that 27 April was a celebration and commemoration of the first post-apartheid elections held on that day in 1994. She said the country was now 23 years into democracy. The elections were the historic first non-racial national elections where everyone of voting age from all race groups, was allowed to vote. "We have organised a soccer tournament for young people and a community Imbizo in Edenville to remind our people that the birth of our South African nation has, like any other, passed through a long and often painful process. The apartheid regime was regarded as the worst atrocity against mankind. When we spoke to the youth, we emphasised that, as young people, they have a fundamental responsibility to defend the gains of our democracy. As Ngwathe Local Municipality we celebrated this day, remembering heroes such as Oliver Tambo, who fought alongside renowned leaders and achieved this freedom, in their lifetime. Oliver Tambo was also a sports activist and an artist who is also remembered this year. We also payed tribute to our heroes who passed away during this month of April such as Chris Hani and Solomon Mahlangu. Their lives and untold sacrifices remind us that our freedom was not free and that it came at a great cost, including life itself," she said. She went on to say that they have committed to renovating the Edenville sports field. In the Inaugural Mayoral Freedom Day Soccer Tournament, Edenville Controllers were crowned the overall champions by defeating Mubs 1 0 at the finals after reaching the top by beating Mighty Bombers 5 4 on penalty shootout while Mubs advanced to final stages after beating Vultures at this one-day soccer competition. Ladies soccer also took center stage, when Tumahole ladies won 3 0 over Mighty Bombers to lift the trophy.
