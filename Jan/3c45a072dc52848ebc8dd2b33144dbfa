The National Consumer Commission (NCC) has launched an investigation into all retailers who sell agricultural produce. Woolworths is being probed over allegations of false labelling for products from Israel.The NCC says it decided to launch an investigation into retailers after receiving complaints from consumers about incorrect food labelling. It stresses that its investigation doesn't only target Woolworths unlike the human rights and Palestine Solidarity organisation Boycotts, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign which is only focusing on Woolworths. The group called for a complete boycott of the company until it ends its trade links with Israel. Several BDS members are Woolworths shareholders and intend raising their concerns at its upcoming AGM on November 30th.BDS South Africa, National Coordinator, Muhammad Desai says , [We] warmly welcome this decision, this is an affirmation of our young democracy that we have watch dogs that are able to take on big corporations and also because we have [been] for a long time saying that Woolworths is falsely labelling its products. The NCC says the investigations on incorrect food labelling could take up to 12 months to complete. Our attempt to get comment from Woolworths was unsuccessful.
