Bloemfontein - About 375 soldiers participated in the South African Army Combat Rifle Shooting Competition held at the De Brug shooting range 30 kilometres outside Bloemfontein. The competition started on Monday and was host by the 44 Parachute Battalion Regiment Unit. Colonel Bruce Motlhoki of the unit said that the aim of the competition was to assess the interns' level of 'readiness' for those situations that required shooting. "We're assessing them to see if we have any candidates that meet an international standard," said Motlhoki. The competition was opened to other countries as well. "We will show that we are just as good as other shooters around the world and we will not be demoralised by the absence of other countries," said Motlhoki. He further said that the competition was an annual occasion aimed to be an extension of the progressive musketry training and the standard of this basic soldiering skill as well as to force preparation processes in the South African Army. "Each year this event welcomes regular and reserve forces as well as international candidates joining to participate. This is just another way to maintain the relationship and benchmark we have with the other countries as it was successfully attended in the previous year," said Motlhoki. Last year, countries such as Lesotho, Belgium, Botswana and other African countries honoured the invite. Motlhoki said that the daily prizes for winners and finals will be on Friday. Soldiers who won on Monday were awarded their medals on Tuesday night. "This is an honour for them for the hard and determination they have shown. We have good soldiers in our camp who are dedicated to their work. On Friday we will have an overall winners awards and present their final scores," said Motlhoki.
