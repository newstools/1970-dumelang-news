The building construction of Makgotamishe plough back to the community. Thabo Dichaba,the director of technical services in the Makgotamishe building construction,said it is their responsibility to improve the disadvantaged youth. The company have donated money to the tournament which was organised in celebration of freedom day. "The most important reason of doing so was because the future of young people is our concern.", said Dichaba. He said they have bought new soccer boots,soccer attire and awards for the players who took part on the soccer tournament. "We also invited the local entertainers to come and keep our viewers happy before starting of the games". He said sports sharpened minds and make a healthy person. Dichaba said they won't give up on fighting against crime. Mpho Motaung (24) who plays for Dikoena Football Club,said more criminal activities in the village are cause by lack of employment. He said companies like Makgotamishe helps them a lot in order to put focus on sports and education. Mpho who plays at the Castle league side said he will play even harder to see himself playing in the Premier Soccer League (PSL). The ward councillor,Raphael Mokoena,thanked the wonderful work done by the building construction. "I wish we can have such businesses that think of saving the future of our young bloods".
