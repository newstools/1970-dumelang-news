Shalom Ministries led by Evangelist Angus Buchan will hold a 'one million man prayer meeting' just outside Bloemfontein on Saturday. According to the angusbuchan website, the evangelist plans to recruit over one million people around the country to join together on 22 April in Bloemfontein and pray for the nation. In a telephone interview with the spokeswoman of Shalom Ministries, Jilly Hull, Bloemfontein was chosen because of its geographical disposition in the country as is in the middle and sharing borders with Gauteng, North West, Eastern Cape, Northern Cape, Mpumalanga and neighbouring country Lesotho.She said many people were expected to come together in a farm four kilometres outside Bloemfontein. Evangelist Angus Buchan said God had spoken to him to have a prayer meeting for a million people in Bloemfontein to pray for South Africa. Bloemfontein was chosen because it is in the center of the country which will make it accessible for everyone, said Hull. In the statement, Evangelist Buchan said one million people were expected at the prayer meeting which would be one of the biggest meetings in South Africa. The day of prayer is intended for all South Africans of all genders, races and denominations who are concerned about the malice, hatred, violence, murder and corruption in the country. It s time to suit the action to the word. We declare war on the disregard for human life and unkindness. On 22 April, we will be drawing a line in the sand, said Buchan. The prayer meeting will start at 10am and end at 4pm on Saturday and Evangelist Buchan is expected to address the throngs of people at midday. Tents have been erected and toilets are provided for the people and everyone have asked not to bring any alcoholic beverages to the venue.
