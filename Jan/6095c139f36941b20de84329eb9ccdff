The Free State Police commissioner Lieu-tenant General Lebeoana Tsumane assured the Welkom community on Wednesday that the cops would still do their jobs despite the fire that consumed 37 vehicles.Tsumane said the vehicles which had been kept in the police yard were burnt down by the fire that they suspected was caused by a cigarette bud which had been thrown in the grass by a passerby. He said the investigations were being launched to find out the person that threw the bud in that careless manner causing the destruc-tion of the vehicles with fire. I appointed a team of experts led by the Deputy Provincial Commissioner, crime detection, MAJOR General Jones Qho-bosheane to investigate and determine the real cause of fire. The community should rest assured that normal policing will not be affected at all as these cars were no longer functioning, said Lt. General Tsumane. Tsumane said the vehicles were not in use but were already earmarked to be de-stroyed as they had been badly damaged in accidents before they could be burnt down. He said the fire-brigade took about 1 hour 15 minutes to douse off the fire which was already burning the dilapidated vehicles.
