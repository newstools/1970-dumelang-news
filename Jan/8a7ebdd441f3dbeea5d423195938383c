MELODING - Twenty-eight-year-old Lefaso Ashly Moseme has been sentenced to 15 years direct imprisonment at the Virginia Regional Court for the gruesome murder of his girlfriend, 32-year-old Nomsa Novumile. On 7 June in 2015 at about 5:45am at Stallite Park, Meloding police received a complaint from Katleho Hospital that Dudayo was stabbed and admitted at the hospital. Dudayo was certified dead later that day. The accused, Moseme, is believed to have assaulted and stabbed Dudayo continuously on the day of the attack, and once he was done, he proceeded to wash the blood off her. It was said that he then found a taxi at a nearby stop and ordered the drive to take Dudayo to hospital where she later died. Moseme was later arrested and charged with murder. Thabong SAPS Cluster Commander, Major General Lerato Molale lauded members of the force for successful arrest and conviction of the murderer. This sentence will deter would-be murderers from engaging in such barbaric acts, concluded Molale.
