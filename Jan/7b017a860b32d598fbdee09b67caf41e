State Security Minister and ANC member, David Mahlobo said the African National Congress (ANC) and the country were under attack by rating agencies. He was speaking at the City Hall in Mangaung on his provincial tour claiming that liberation movements were being attacked all over Africa, in countries such as Mozambique, Angola, Tanzania and Zimbabwe because of the continents rich mineral resources. Mahlobo said the African National Congress was under attack from the western imperialists and colonisers because it had been in power for more than 20 years. He said some people would acquire ANC membership so that they could destroy the party by weakening it while pretending to be members. He said it was important to tread carefully in not being suspicious of one another in the movement.He said the fourth industrial revolution was being waged in Africa because the continent was rich in mineral resources. Mahlobo said he was inspired by coming to the Free State because it was where the ANC was born. He said even though there was a difficult journey ahead, the ANC had to give hope to the people because it was the movement of the future, for children and the whole nation. Mahlobo said some people were starting to write the obituary of the ANC and alliance partners. It is important to know what kind of nation we are building. Comrades ANC, our movement, your movement is under attack. When President OR Tambo gave us our movement in 1991 in Westville University, he said he was giving our movement back much stronger. He said no one was going to defeat ANC except the ANC itself. The world we are living in is not straight, said Mahlobo. South Africa has been downgraded by two powerful rating agencies Standard &amp; Poors and Fitch last week, following President Jacob Zuma s reshuffling of cabinet and removing of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan.
