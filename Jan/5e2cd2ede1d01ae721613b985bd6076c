QWAQWA - The Municipality of Maluti-A-Phofung (MAP) together with Mofumahadi Manapo Mopeli regional hospital at Phuthaditjhaba, Qwaqwa last week hosted a motivational talk for the workers. Vusimusi Tshabalala, the MAP's Executive Mayor, told Dumelang News that workers are human beings and therefore, they needed to be motivated. "As the municipality, we have been aware that in most cases, we put blame over the shoulders of our workers who perform poorly, forgetting that most of them have personal problems from home too. Simultaneously, they also have to perform well in their duties at work every day for long hours," said Tshabalala. He further pointed out that working with people can cause a loads of stress. "We have learnt that our workers need to be motivated by professionals. Our task as the municipal leaders is to ensure that all sectors of work are monitored because at the end of the day, we are expecting the best from them," concluded Tshabalala. Daniel Mokwena, a motivator from I-CAN, said he is grateful to the executive mayor for bringing them down to Qwaqwa to encourage the workers. Mokwena said it is very difficult for everyone to work under depressing situations. "A person can even be motivated by everything they are given. Hence we believe that from now on, the workers would have an effective production at their workplaces," said Mokwena. One of the workers, Mathapelo Mokaeane (42), said the motivation session is likely to bring an improvement in the quality of work from the hospital staff. "Not having anyone to motivate me under the challenging conditions that I am living under took its toll on me. Hopefully, from now it will be better," she said.
