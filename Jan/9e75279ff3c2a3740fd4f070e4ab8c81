However, it is the Proteas batsman and wicket, Quinton de Kock who leads the overall race with a number of nominees including the ODI as well as the Test Cricketer of the Year nominations and the Award of Excellence among others. He is also among the nominees for the top award of the evening, the SA Cricketer of the Year, where he will be competing with his teammates in the national setup, captain, Faf du Plessis, fast bowler, Kagiso Rabada as well as spinner, Imran Tahir. Our country continues to produce world-class players.
