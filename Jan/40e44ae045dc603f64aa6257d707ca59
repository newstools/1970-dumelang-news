Opposition parties have welcomed the ruling by the High Court in Pretoria that President Jacob Zuma must explain his axing of Pravin Gordhan and other cabinet ministers in his March cabinet reshuffle. Zuma has to give his reasons within five days. The President initially cited an intelligence report as the reason for axing Gordhan. Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane has described the court judgment as a victory for all South Africans. Congress of the People (COPE) spokesperson, Dennis Bloem has a similar views to that of the DA leader. President Zuma must know that we are now in a constitutional democracy he can't do as he wishes. COPE is very eager to wait and see if President Zuma is still going to use the fake intelligent report as his reason for reshuffling. The African National Congress (ANC) has expressed the hope that President Zuma will appeal against Thursday s High Court judgment ordering him to give reasons for his firing of Pravin Gordhan and other cabinet ministers. The ANC has called the judgment a dangerous precedent.
