A stupendous century stand by two of India s most exciting young guns, Rishabh Pant and Sanju Samson, enabled the Delhi Daredevils to crush the Gujarat Lions by seven wickets in a record run chase with 15 balls to spare in a dramatic IPL clash in Delhi on Thursday night. The Lions, having put up a seemingly challenging total thanks to dynamic half-centuries from Suresh Raina and Dinesh Karthik, would have been confident of breaking their duck in terms of defending their totals in matches this year. They never came close, thanks to Pant and Samson, who devastated their bowlers. The left-handed Pant slammed six fours and nine sixes in his sizzling 43-ball innings of 97, while opener Samson didn t even bother with fours, lofting seven sixes in his 61 in 31 balls. So dominant were the home team s batsmen, in fact, that a total of 20 sixes were blasted in the Delhi run-glut, just one short of the IPL record.
