MEC for Economic and small business development, tourism and environmental affairs (Destea) Benny Malakoane said every consumer had the rights. He was speaking in Kroonstad where 10 Consumer protection court officials were being sworn in at Seeisoville Community Hall on Wednesday, during the world consumer rights day. Malakoane said people could use the internet to gain knowledge about their rights as consumers. Every person has the rights when buying goods or services from the seller. Our department has the responsibility to teach the consumers by doing public campaigns, public gatherings and spreading the messages via radio and newspapers. People could also get the information from the internet so that they can make informed decisions, said Malakoane.He said it was important that the consumers protected their rights by knowing the consumer protection rights act. Malakoane said a customer had the right to return a product that he is not pleased with and claim his money back. However, there were sellers who had ridiculous policies but the consumer protection court was there to ensure recourse for the customer. He said the consumer protection court would speed up the process of dealing with the consumer s complaints. Malakoane said at own risk words plastered at the Malls was insincere because there were security guards who guarded the customers cars and that there were cameras which were installed to ensure that any suspicious movement was recorded for the safety of the cars. On a lighter note Malakoane said he did not know how to use the social media such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and others because he did not want to.
