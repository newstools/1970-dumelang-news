ANC Free State spokesperson Thabo Meeko, has confirmed the date for the party s provincial elective conference which will be held in August at Premier Ace Magashule's hometown, Parys. The highly anticipated conference will be held from 10 August to 13 August 2017. Meeko said the conference is in line with Rule 17 of the Constitution of the ANC as amended and adopted at the 53rd National Conference, Mangaung, 2012. The constitution directs the provincial conferences to be held once every four years or when it is requested by one third of all branches in the province. The conference shall be constituted by 90 percent of delegates from branches. There will also be delegates and guests from leagues of the ANC and members of the society, he said.The conference will consider reports by the Provincial Executive Committee to assess work done over the past four years. Meeko indicated that a preliminary audit of branches by the party s provincial leadership is underway to verify whether branches are in good standing prior to the conference. The PEC further wish to confirm the confidence it has in all activists of the ANC to rise to defend the unity of the organisation in charting the path for the radical economic transformation, he said. We also wish to reject insinuations of war towards the conference as an intention to plant mutiny and divisions in the ANC. The leadership discussions are opened and ANC structures are engaging frankly and democratically with each other, Meeko added. Dismissing internal party squabbles, Meeko said the upcoming conference will be used to demonstrate the party s discipline and strengthen the movement to defeat all divisive elements whose interest are against everything the ANC represents. We also dismiss the allegations that the ANC intends on victimising the workers as a result of their participation during May Day Rally. The ANC is committed to workers rights including their right to protest as enshrined in the constitution frica, he said.
