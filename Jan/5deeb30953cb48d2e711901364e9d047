POTCHEFSTROOM - Sprinters were the star performers as expected setting an explosive start on the first of two days of competition at the ASA Senior track and field and combined events championships at Kenneth McArthur Athletics Stadium in Potchefstroom. Brushing off the cool conditions Olympic finalist Akani Simbine outclassed a quality line-up to reclaim the SA 100m title he won in Stellenbosch two years ago. Simbine crossed the line in 9.95, with Olympic 400m champion Wayde van Niekerk dropping down in distance to take the silver medal in 10.04.Thando Roto earned bronze, also clocking 10.04.Pre-race favourite Carina Horn, who narrowly missed the SA record (11.06) when she clocked 11.10 in the semifinals, pulled out of the Women's 100m final due to illness. In her absence, defending champion Alyssa Conley stormed to victory in 11.41, edging Tebogo Mamatu into second position by 0.03. Today it was proof that South Africa is back, said Aleck Skhosana, the President of ASA. This is quality that this nation has missed over the years. We have clearly moved from the times of squabbling amongst each other. He further said: the athletes are performing, coaches are coaching and administration are administrating just in should be. That is what this administration has committed itself to when we took over and we thank the athletes and coaches for a great work done. Athletics SA has confirmed as correct the entrant of SA-born athlete Karin Mey, who earned bronze for Turkey at the 2009 World Championships
