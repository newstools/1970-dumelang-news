Dramatic FC from Bergman Square took dramatic steps from the bottom of the log to the Top 8 spot. The passionate boys started the SAB League in Mangaung Metro region poorly which landed them at the relegation zone. However, the team management gathered together and bolsters the coaching department as well as new signings. Currently the team is sitting at position 7 and still aiming to end the league at least in top six. The club chairman Jonas Teenage Koae said they had to take a serious action to change things. We were at position 16 when I took the action, I had to get a coach from my ex-players without qualification to help team get out of the relegation zone, said Koae. I would like to thank all our management for trusting me and supporting me on my actions during difficult times, thanks guys. The club also had a voluntarily coaching boost from the professional qualified coach Thabo Jeff Khotseng who holds a Fifa Coever. The on form team turned to their winning ways since the beginning of the year with no financial sponsorship, it is surviving with the salaries of individuals because the SAB League does not have the subsidy for the teams.
