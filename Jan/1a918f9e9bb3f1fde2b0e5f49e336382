In its efforts to accelerate economic growth and development in designated regions of the country, President Jacob Zuma is set to launch the Maluti-A-Phofung Special Economic Zone (MAP-SEZ) in Tshiame, near Harrismith, in the eastern Free State, on April 25.Trade and Industry Minister Dr Rob Davies said the launch of the 1 038 ha MAP-SEZ is another significant milestone in the implementation of the department s special economic zone programme. The Industrial Policy Action Plan identifies SEZs as key contributors to economic development. They are growth engines towards government's strategic objectives of industrialisation, regional development and employment creation. The SEZ programme has entered a full implementation phase. This is one of the critical instruments that the DTI is using to accelerate industrialisation in the country, said Davies. He added that the SEZ programme was a critical tool for the attraction of foreign direct investments (FDIs), creation of decent jobs, establishment of new industrial centres, as well as development and improvement of the existing infrastructure. The MAP-SEZ will create opportunities for manufacturing as well as a regional and international trade environment with added value chain within the Maluti-A-Phofung municipality. The social and economic benefits, as well as regional development, will be key and will be enhanced by creating a prosperous trade city and functional trade ecosystem, which will enable the beneficiation of mineral and natural resources and attract FDI. The priority sectors for the MAP-SEZ are automotive, agro-processing, logistics, pharmaceuticals and general processing , said Free State Premier Ace Magashule
