Maluti-A-Phofung Executive Mayor, Vusi Tshabalala, urged political and traditional leaders to work together for the benefit of society. Tshabalala was speaking at a public gathering held at Matebeleng Village in Ward 8 on Saturday. He also paid a visit to Queen Moshoeshoe Mopeli who was excited to see the mayor at the royal kraal. Tshabalala said he had come to fulfil the promises he had made during his campaigning, before being re-elected into power during last year s local government elections. I had made promises from when I was the Chief Whip that I would improve your lives. I have come to hear from you so that I can do whatever is in my power to change your lives. I m here to give you hope that the African National Congress has the capability to improve your lives. You should trust in us because we want to unite this party, said Tshabalala.He pleaded with the leaders to stop fighting among themselves because the fights spiralled out of control affecting the community. Tshabalala said the EPWP projects should be allocated equitably so as to avoid complaints from the community who might feel like they were being discriminated against. He said that he was going to pay R1200 for Grade 12 pupils for winter boot-camps. Tshabalala visited Tlhonolofatso Creche and Lekgulo sports ground whereby he continued speaking to the people. Queen Moshoeshoe Mopeli said she could not believe her eyes when she saw Tshabalala paying her a visit. I thank God with the miracle he has done by sending the mayor to the royal family. It s like I m dreaming when I see the mayor here, I m even trembling. I say he should continue working for the community. I m very proud about his visit to my place, said Mopeli.
