The Sunrisers Hyderabad suffered their first defeat of the Indian Premier League season as the Mumbai Indians defeated them by four wickets at the Wankhede Stadium on Wednesday night. The Mumbai Indians put in their best performance of the season so far as they defeated the champions to claim their second victory in three matches in front of the partisan crowd. It was always going to be a tough task for the visitors, who could only muster 158 for eight from their allotted overs. The hosts got off to a flier thanks to Jos Buttler and Parthiv Patel as they struck 28 off the first three overs. An impressive stand then followed between Patel and Nitish Rana, as they hit a quick 38 off the next five overs to keep the Mumbai Indians afloat. Rana struck two sixes and three fours, and by the time he was dismissed by Bhuvneshwar Kumar for 45, the damage was already done, for Krunal Pandya had his say in the matter too, blasting three sixes on his way to 37 off 20 balls.
