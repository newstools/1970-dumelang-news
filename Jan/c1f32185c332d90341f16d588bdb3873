The Wham! singer will finally get the send off he deserves this month - 10 weeks after his tragic passing on Christmas Day (25.12.16) - after a coroner revealed earlier this week that he died of natural causes, but his grieving relatives have decided to keep details about the ceremony close to their chests as they don't want fans turning up. According to the Daily Star newspaper, a representative for the legendary star refused to comment on "private matters" when asked if funeral details would be released soon. Following extensive testing - including toxicology - over the past two and a bit months, it was announced on Monday (06.03.17) by the coroner's office that the 'Careless Whisper' hitmaker died of dilated cardiomyopathy with myocarditis and fatty liver. George passed away at the age of 53 after his heart failed to pump blood around his body due to an enlarged left ventricle, while his liver was also clogged up with fat.
