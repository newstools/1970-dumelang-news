The discovery of bones belonging to a child was shockingly made when construction workers dug a trench in Clocolan on Tuesday. The construction workers from the Make Fame Construction Company were digging trenches in the location of Makosholo in Clocolan, during a project that seeks to eradicate bucket system toilets, when they dug out a skull and the bones of a child. At present, it is not known to whom the bones belonged, but police were investigating the matter. Moeketsi Makelefane (33) was digging the trench with his other three colleagues when they dug out the skull and the bones. Makelefane said he reported the discovery of the bones to his boss who then called the police. Police spokesperson, Captain Phumelelo Dhlamini, said an inquest had been registered and the bones had been taken to a laboratory to do a DNA test to determine to whom the bones belonged.
