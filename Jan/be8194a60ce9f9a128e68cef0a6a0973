A South African medical doctor, Glenda Gray has been awarded a spot in TIME magazine s prestigious 100 most influential people list as a pioneer in her field of HIV/AIDS research. Gray is currently the president and CEO of the South African Medical Research Council and is widely acknowledged as one the few people on the forefront of Aids research worldwide. Gray decided to fight the virus and the silence around it through research, according to TIME editor Siobhan O Connor. Thanks in part to her work on mother-to-child transmission, the number of babies born with HIV has dropped from 600,000 a year to 150,000. Now, she s set her sights on a way to inoculate infants before they re ever put at risk. Her ongoing HIV-vaccine study is the largest of its kind ever conducted in South Africa, and with it, Gray is once again doing her part to make sure that the science of HIV and the conversation around it never stops evolving.
