Toyota Cheetahs play hosts to the Highlanders this weekend, another tough encounter in space of seven days, but coach, Franco Smith believes that s the only way to get better . Fresh from their resounding 21-48 loss to the Crusaders, the Cheetahs will be looking to avoid second straight loss in their own backyard. But, they will have to ensure that they don t repeat the same mistakes that cost them against the only unbeaten side in this year s Super Rugby last week. Against the side from New Zealand, too many missed tackles, particularly at crucial times let the Cheetahs down. However, with all that behind them, they have yet another mountain to climb on Friday as they not only seek redemption, but also to turn their good moments to positive results. While this will be the mission, Smith believes the more they play tough teams, the more his side gets better. I still believe that growth of this side is immense. To have a team play against the best every week is the only way to get better. We re a good team with ball in hand and we want to play best to our strengths, he said. Smith rang a few changes, with notable ones being that of the inclusions of William Small-Smith and Fred Zeilinga. Small-Smith takes the place of Nico Lee at centre after he sustained an ankle injury which is set to keep him out of action for close to six weeks. The fit again Zeilinga returns from injury and drops Marais to the bench. Meanwhile, upfront, Carl Wegner and Francois Uys partner at lock while Shaun Venter makes way for Tian Meyer at scrumhalf, with the latter set to run onto the field in his 50th Super Rugby match. Kickoff at the Toyota Stadium on Friday is at 7pm .
