A well-known Mzansi comedian tickled the funny bone of the 'Kasi people at his latest offering in Kroonstad this past week. Chris Mapane, who is head and shoulders above many comedians, cracked jokes at the Seeiso Community Hall in Kroonstad on Wednesday at the World Consumer day celebrations. In his skits he made jokes about women who dance in clubs with their friends. Mapane said men should not disturb women when they are dancing because every conversation would result in crazy hand gestures and changing of faces.Mapane demonstrated how women dance in clubs especially when they are dancing to Wololo a song by songstress Babes Wodumo. He added that churches took a long time during prayer services because young women liked to sing elongated hymns and praise songs so as to impress the young pastors. People gathered at the World Consumer Day celebrations were left in stitches as Mapane demonstrated all the moves and also singing imitating church choir singers, by kneeling and raising his hands above his head in a worshipping manner. I like performing in the location with my people because I don t have to use a lot of English as I use my own language. Nothing beats live performance and we are able to deliver strong messages in a funny way. People become attentive when we tell jokes about real life issues such as musicians who are being bankrupted by their record companies or politicians failing to do their jobs, he said in an exclusive interview with Dumelang News. Mapane said he had toured Europe and most Southern African countries and said that he was able to perform for different audiences.
