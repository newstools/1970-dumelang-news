Just moments after finishing a media briefing in Johannesburg, Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader, Julius Malema, was handed summons by police over an incident at the University of the Free State in 2014, for calling on people to occupy vacant land around the country. Malema was served with the summons by the Director of Priority Crimes following the press briefing. The summons relates to an incident that took place in Mangaung in December 2014. At the said media briefing in Braamfontein, Johannesburg, the EFF has called for a march against government on 2 November the same day that Finance Minister, Pravin Gordhan, is set to appear in court. Malema has been served with a summons to appear in court in Newcastle on the 7th of November, and again on the 14th of November in the Bloemfontein Magistrates Court. EFF Deputy President Floyd Shivambu has condemned the decision to serve the EFF leader with the summons. Meanwhile, Malema says South Africa must call on President Jacob Zuma and the National Director of Public Prosecutions (NPA), Shaun Abraham, to step down. The EFF commander-in-chief has accused the Gupta family of using the NPA to force Gordhan to resign. Malema says the protest will also focus on calling for free education for students.
