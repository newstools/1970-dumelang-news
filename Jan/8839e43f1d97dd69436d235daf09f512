The provincial Department of Social Development visited the Maluti-A-Phofung (MAP) municipality on Saturday, where they celebrated International Women s Day which is observed on March 8. According to Limakatso Mahasa, MEC for Social Development, her visit was to acknowledge the vital role that women of South Africa played during the apartheid regime. "Our mothers and sisters had dedicated their lives to fighting for us to have a better future. We therefore need to praise and remember the struggles faced by our heroines. We need to remind women how much they are worth and can do. Women are still settling for the lower positions at work, which is very wrong. Women must work in the top positions just like men," Mahasa said. She promised to work hard in order to bring a proper equality and management in her own department. "I am aware of the fraud taking place in the department. In a very short space of time, I guarantee there will be no more cases of fraud. We are working smoothly with our different offices to ensure that women are getting better treatment, she added. The MEC also assured the women of the community, together with the other beneficiaries, that they were aware of the pressing financial responsibilities of households that rested on their shoulders and that government grants will be paid in full on April 1, as per usual and that people should not panic. The Executive Mayor of Maluti-a-Phofung, Cllr. Vusi Tshabalala welcomed the visit of MEC Mahasa and upheld the sentiment of her message. He said that all men should respect their mothers, wives and sisters. "In every man's success, there a role played by a woman," said Tshabalala. He further mentioned that citizens must take care of people living with disability. "I urge everyone to feel the pain of being disable. People living with disability did not choose to be on that situation," he added.
