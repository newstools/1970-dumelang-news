Nkhetheni Masupa and his fellow Dikgaka Athletes are happy with what they have achieved thus far as part of their preparations for the Comrades Marathons next month. The athletes, under the umbrella of Goldfields TVET, started the 2017 year the same way they ended 2016 with a hectic schedule. They have been part of a number of races including the Welkom Mielie marathon in January, the Sasol Marathon, Surrender Hill in Clarens, the Vaal Marathon and recently, the Two Oceans Marathon in Cape Town. The runners also took part in preparation for the upcoming 92nd Comrades Marathon in a month s time, and Masupa is impressed with the preparations. It s exciting. This year is an uprun Comrades Marathon, and we will be running almost 90km from Durban to Pietermaritzburg, given 12 hours time allowance to finish the marathon, Masupa told Dumelang Sport. Many running athletes around the world are busy finalising their preparation training schedules to see themselves finishing this internationally recognised ultimate human race, said Masupa. Last year, Dikgaka Athletes was also part of the Mandela Day marathon in Pietermaritzburg. We targeted mostly the difficult marathon routes, like the Jacaranda Marathon in Pretoria, the Soweto Marathon and then the most difficult Mokhotlong Marathon in Lesotho at the end of this year in December, Masupa said.
