Last Saturday Ntsu Secondary School in Bethlehem officially opened its new school buildings to the delight of staff, former learners, Department of Education District officials and members of the community. Among the dignitaries that attended the occasion was former School Principal Mosiuwa Machere and Thabo Mofutsanyana Mayor Malefu Vilakazi. The school was established in 1994 with grade 8 which was known as Standard 6. Learners who have started with the school in 1994 gradually went on to establish other grades until the school has its first matriculates in 1998. Ntsu is known for producing good results since its inception whilst discipline is highly practiced at the school. Ntsu started by platooning classes at Tiisetsang High School in 1994 before moving to the current premises in March 1995 after Morewag Skool closed down. Ntsu Secondary School was housed in Morewag's old asbestos buildings before the Free State Government took initiative to build a new school building for the school. Leading the official opening of the new school buildings was School Principal Moeketsi Masiteng and dignitaries including those from the Education Department. Renaming of school's admin block after the former School Principal Mosiuwa Machere also occurred during the day.
