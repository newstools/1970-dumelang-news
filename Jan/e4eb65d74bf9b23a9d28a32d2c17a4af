Orlando Pirates and Bloemfontein Celtic may be enduring inconsistent runs in the league thus far, but have been in top form as far as the Nedbank Cup campaign is concerned, which is what makes their battle in the quarterfinal this weekend a crunch one. Pirates host Phunya Sele Sele in the last eight-round at Orlando Stadium on Saturday, as both sides seek successes as a way of amending their disappointing league seasons. Pirates, who downed another Free State outfit in Stars in the previous round, will undoubtedly be more focused on making it further in the competition they almost clinched last season, more than anything. However, they will have a tough task at hand as they face Celtic, who have not won any major title since the 2012 Telkom Knockout. Pirates brushed aside Stars 4-1 while Celtic saw off Mbombela United 2-1 in the last round. In other matches on Saturday, Chippa United and Golden Arrows host Jomo Cosmos and Platinum Stars respectively, at 3pm while Stuart Baxter s Supersport United pay his former employers Kaizer Chiefs a visit at FNB Stadium at 6pm.
