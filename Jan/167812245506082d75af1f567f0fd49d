Cristiano Ronaldo's sensational goal scoring record was hailed as "unique" by boss Zinedine Zidane as his latest hat-trick left Real Madrid on the verge of another Champions League final by thrashing Atletico Madrid 3-0. Ronaldo's treble was his second against Atletico this season and second straight in the Champions League after hitting three past Bayern Munich in the quarter-finals. "Goalscoring is something he has over others, that is what makes him unique," said Zidane. Victory extended Real's hex over Atletico in the Champions League over the past four seasons. Real have eliminated Diego Simeone's men in each of the past three years, including in the 2014 and 2016 finals, by the finest of margins.However, there was a gulf between the sides this time round as Ronaldo's 10th minute header opened the scoring. And they struck twice more in the final 20 minutes to give the scoreline the reflection Real's dominance deserved. "The team was tremendous. I scored the goals but the team was phenomenal from start to finish," said Ronaldo. Victory also kept Real on course to become the first side to retain the Champions League in 27 years. "We played great, it is not easy to score three goals (against Atletico)," added Zidane. "The first half hour was fantastic, we had a lot of chances to score the second, but we got it in the second-half. "We are very happy with the performance. To score three goals and most importantly in a (two-legged) tie keep a clean sheet at home is very important." Ronaldo is now just one goal behind Barcelona rival Lionel Messi as the Champions League's top scorer this season with 10.
