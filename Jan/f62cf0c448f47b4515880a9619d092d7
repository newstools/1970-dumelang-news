Bloemfontein Celtic and Free State Stars will be hoping for a much improved performance in the Nedbank Cup - a better one compared to the one they have been enduring in the league lately - when they get their last 32 round underway this weekend. Celtic will be travelling to North West to play Buya Msuthu at Moruleng Stadium while Highlands Park pay Stars a visit at Goble Park, with both matches scheduled for tomorrow, at 3pm and 8:15pm respectively. Phunya Sele Sele, whose league form has been disappointing, will have a tough task against the Teboho Moloi s charges. However, winger, Khethokwakhe Masuku, is still confident the tables will turn, but laments luck as one factor the team is lacking. It's bad times, but luck hasn't been on our side as well. I can't say exactly what it is that we need to do to get out of the situation. But I do believe our coaches will come with a plan and as players we can only follow their instructions, Masuku said. In this competition last year, Celtic were knocked out in the first round by Wits while Stars went as far as the semi-finals, but only to be hammered 4-2 by Orlando Pirates in their own backyard. Alike Celtic, Stars have also been struggling to find form in the league, and Letsoaka is more concerned about his side's failure to hold ball possession, which he said was the case against Highlands Park in their 1-0 league loss last week. Elsewhere, another Free State outfit, Odendaalsrus-based Second Division outfit, Days FC, will have their work cut out when they host Mbombela United at Griffons Rugby Stadium on Sunday. Kick-off is at 3pm.
