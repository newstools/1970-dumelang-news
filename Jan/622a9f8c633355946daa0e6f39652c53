Executive mayor of the Dihlabeng Local Municipality, Lindiwe Makhalema, has promised the angry community of Silahliwe Informal Settlement in Bohlokong that they will be moved to their new houses in Vogelfontein before the end of this week. Makhalema said this when addressing the devastated resident who blocked roads with burning tires to show their frustration last week. She told them that they were going to take about 104 people to the newly developed area. She said she was going to have a meeting with Sisi Ntombela, MEC for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs to decide the way forward. You are going to get your house. I am sure you would be moved before the end of next week, she said.About 64 people of the 500 or so people were moved to the area late last year when president Jacob Zuma, was in Bethlehem for the closing of 16 Days of Activism Against Women and Children. According to Shanyana Sithole (34), a community leader, a second group of people should have been moved to their houses some two months ago after a first group was moved late last year. But the community claims that no one is giving them the attention that they need with regards to the answers of when they would be moved. Shanyana has warned the mayor by saying We are tired of your lies. If you don t move us before the end of the week, you will see. He said they will make sure that no one goes to school and all the roads are burning. We know that they don t cooperate when we talk to them peacefully. We will show them what we are made of. We are tired of people who only need us during the elections then after that they treat us like rubbish, he said.
