The league action returns with a bang this weekend and the battle for three points continues as the season enters its last two months. While some teams may feel the international break came at the time they had picked up positive momentum, others like Bloemfontein Celtic and Free State Stars undoubtedly needed the break more to regroup. The Free State outfits are in danger of dropping down to relegation zone if their streaks of poor results continue this weekend. Ea Lla Koto host Orlando Pirates at Goble Park on Saturday (6pm), while Celtic, on the other hand, will have a tough task against their new mentor s former employers, Polokwane City on Sunday (3pm).Despite the results not coming their way, Celtic s Chief Operations Officer, Chabeli Motsamali believes the team has been working hard to turn things around. The team s been doing quite well behind closed doors. Our new coach s been hard at work with the guys, working on their mental strength as well as fitness. They know they can do well, but now it s all about the coach sharpening their fitness and mental strength, he told Dumelang Sport. Celtic s 0-all draw with Cape Town City in their last outing placed them at the 14th spot with 19 points after four wins apiece with their neighbours, Stars, who occupy the 15th following their 2-all draw with Ajax Cape Town. Both sides are just four points away from the relegation zone. Our focus now is getting our season back on track. We re not at the best position on the log now; we need to move out there ASAP before we find ourselves in danger. Meanwhile, Motsamai believes the situation the Free State giants find themselves in is temporary; all shall be well in no time. It s not the position where both sides want to see themselves in or should be. We don t even want to think the worst, but just need to keep fighting and pull ourselves out of the situation. Both sides will continue the fight, and neither the teams will be relegated, he concluded
