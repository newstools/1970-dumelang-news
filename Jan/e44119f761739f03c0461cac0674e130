The launch, commemorated under the theme Climate is changing, food and agriculture must too is an ongoing partnership aimed at elevating the level of awareness on food security issues in communities. Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, General Bheki Cele said: Today we are launching the ploughing period. We opted to come to Free State for this. We are also launching World Food Day. We opted for the Free State because the province is our basket of green food and maize. Free State MEC for Agriculture and Rural Development, Oupa Khoabane, said: The significance of this day is to start planting because the time has come although we are still encountering drought. Farmers should prepare their soil for planting. Therefore, let us start working from now onwards, said Khoabane.
