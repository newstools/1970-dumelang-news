Is that special lock nut for your mag wheels still where you think it is? Better make sure! If your car is equipped with run flat tyres and doesn t have a spare, you should also have a full can of emergency tyre filler in the boot. It s not always possible to find certain sizes of run flat tyres in every Karoo dorp, and waiting around for a new tyre is going to dampen the fun factor very quickly.Many caravans and trailers stand forgotten for big chunks of the year, so it s important to do the same safety checks on these. Vital safety tips to remember Tyres can degrade over time, and your home from home needs to have working brakes unless you re aiming to get to the bottom of Van Reenen s in record time.Check your wheel bearings, too. When you pack a car or trailer of any description, it s worth considering your centre of gravity. Pack the heavy stuff low down and the lighter stuff on top you ll have better stability, especially at speed. Inside the car, think of loose items as missiles. In an emergency stop, everything not secured will become airborne and put you and your family at risk of serious injury. 'Be safe' Once you get on the road, all the usual road safety rules apply: don t allow grumpy kids to distract you, make regular caffeine stops to help you stay alert, keep your cool when maniacs try to pass you in oncoming traffic. Make it easier by keeping the kids occupied with toys or games, and research your route before you leave there are always interesting places to stop and small towns often have great local restaurants and guesthouses. If you see your journey as an adventure rather than as a marathon race with a time limit, you will arrive feeling less stressed and a lot happier. Wishing everyone a good break, safe travel and a very happy Easter! #keepitsafe
