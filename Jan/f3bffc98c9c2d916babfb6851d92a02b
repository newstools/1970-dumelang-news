While redeeming themselves on home soil would be the key focus this weekend, Bloemfontein Celtic would also be looking to welcome the new mentor with maximum points. Siwelele host the high-flying Cape Town City in Bloemfontein at Dr Molemela, in what will be Luc Eymael s debut at the helm after the being lured at the City of Roses on a two-and-half-year deal recently. Eymael took over from Lehlohonolo Seema and John Maduka, who co coached since the departure of Serame Letsoaka in October 2016. Upon Eymael s arrival, Seema was tasked to assist him while Maduka returned to his position as team manager. Eymael, who resigned from Polokwane City the day prior to being announced as the new mentor, will have his work cut out against the title chasers. The Capetonians have been on form lately, which has seen them climb to the top of the table. Unlike the men from Bloemfontein who have endured a tough ride in the last couple of months. They now find themselves a point away from danger zone after 19 games. In their last league outing, Celtic were humbled 3-1 by log leaders, Bidvest Wits while City stunned Mamelodi Sundowns 1-0 in what was their second league win over the Brazilians this season. Celtic come into the match more confident than their opponents following a win in the Nedbank Cup last 32 round while the Citizens were brought down in their clash. Kickoff at the Dr Molemela Stadium is at 6pm on Saturday.
