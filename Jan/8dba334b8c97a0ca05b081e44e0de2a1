The executive mayor of the Thabo Mofutsanyana district municipality, Malefu Vilakazi says it was time that the ANC ward councillors do introspection and ask themselves if they were still working fairly for the people. We should do an introspection on ourselves. I think the time has come that we asked ourselves that are still what people want us to be. Are we still working for those people who have voted for us, she says. Vilakazi was speaking at the municipalities IDP road show which was hosted at the Sediba Community Hall in Tshiame near Harrismith on Thursday.She said that when responding to some of the question asked on the floor by people who had attended the IDP. When listening to some of the things here, one fails to understand why they haven t been solved because a ward councillor could have dealt with. We should remember that we are not doing anyone a favour by hosting meeting in our wards. We should do it because we have taken an oath that we will work for our people, she said. She said they were on those positions because of the people who entrusted them with them and they should do justice to them. We should always humble ourselves before the community. We all know that it is not easy to work for the community but we should always strive to make them happy by giving them services, she said. She has urged the councillors that they should be open on things that they could do and those that they can t. When you tell people the truth, they will always believe in you. But if you keep on making empty promises they will never respect you. I was a ward councillor too. And one of the things which were working for me was that I was always in the community that I was serving. And by so doing it gave me a chance to know most of the people and their problems. You should have a data base of your ward that will help you, she said.
