The Hawks say more arrests are expected in their investigations into a plot to assassinate officials who are perceived to be state capture beneficiaries. They arrested a 23-year-old man in Midrand for allegedly being part of the plot. He will appear in court on Friday to face a charge of conspiracy to commit murder. Officers intercepted communication material of possible assassinations of several members of Cabinet, state-owned entities and other prominent South Africans. The suspect is a founding member of the Anti-State Capture Death Squad Alliance. During the investigation another group, the Anti-White Monopoly Capitalists Regime surfaced which necessitated a two-pronged approach. Speaking on AM Live, Hawks spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi says their investigations started about six months ago. We knew about it in October last year after letters were sent to different companies by this suspect requesting funding for his organisation. It was explicitly made clear that there are people that have been targeted, snipers as well that have been recruited to do assassinations and possibly have a coup in this country.
