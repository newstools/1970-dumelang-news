The Premier of the Free State, Ace Magashule, recently encouraged pupils from across the province to be the best versions of themselves at Gariep Dam, on Tuesday. Magashule was speaking to more than 250 pupils from various schools after the presentation of the Budget Vote . He said the students should have big dreams and never stop dreaming of becoming great people that South Africa would be proud of. He said the pupils should play hard and study smart and shun alcohol because it affected the way one used his mind. When I grew up, my father was not there but my mother made sure that I got the best education and that has helped me to be where I am today. I can dream of being president and if I want to, I can become one if I persevere. You should also persevere in pursuing your dreams because without dreams we are nothing, said Magashule. He said he was not going to be the premier of the Free State for a long time but was sure that he was going to leave the province in the capable hands of MECs such as Sisi Ntombela, Butana Khompela, Benny Malakoane and Tate Makgoe. Magashule said he had asked universities in Belarus, Brazil, China and Portugal to give the children from the Free State an opportunity to study at their institutions. He said education was the key to unlock every aspect of life. Magashule said the youth should enjoy life and avoid abusing drugs. He also asked them to vote for ANC when they were old because ANC was the only oldest liberation movement in Africa which still existed even today.
