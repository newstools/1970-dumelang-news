The Qwaqwa musician who exploded onto the social media and traditional media over the weekend said it was all planned out. Nonhlanhla Qwabe (33) who is known by her stage name Skolopad from Masimong in Qwaqwa, in the Eastern Free State, has become the media sensation after she deliberately wore a ripped yellow dress, revealing her thunder thighs at the recently held Metro FM Music Awards in Durban at Inkosi Luthili Convention Center. Qwabe said she knew people would talk about her. She said she had been knocking on different doors so that she could be signed as a musician but nothing was happening.Qwabe is not just a wannabe musician but a professional nurse doing the work of Florence Nightingale in caring for the sick in a hospital in Bethlehem. She is a mother of a 16-year-old-daughter and has 12 songs under belt on her yet to be released album Tlo Boneng . Qwabe said she loved her body so much that she felt like showing it to the world, without any hesitation. I m very happy and proud about what I have achieved because I had planned a long time ago that I was going to attend the Metro FM Awards and steal the show.Everyone has been talking about me on social media and radio stations and I m not bothered at all. I love the attention that I got and I m praying that I get signed by a reputable record company, Qwabe said.She said she was a mother, a nurse and an artist and had time to play her roles with great aplomb. Qwabe has been praised and ridiculed in the media but she said she was not bothered by the negative feedback because she achieved what she had set out to do, to get people talking.
