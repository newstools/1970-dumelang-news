Bafana Bafana stand-in coach Owen da Gama said laying a solid foundation for the future was more important than getting positive results in the two recent friendlies. Da Gama has been criticised for making wholesome changes to the team that drew against Angola on Tuesday. Only three players in the 25-man squad never got a chance to play in the two matches. Against Angola da Gama boldly started with two under-20 players, Luther Singh and Phakamani Mahlambi, as well as Mamelodi Sundowns sensation Percy Tau."The average age of the team for the first game was 26. When you look at the frontline from yesterday the average age was 21, so I think it augurs very well but that doesn't say there's no other player that can be included that is doing very well that is outside this group. The new coach, whatever happens, will have very strong recommendations, said da Gama. The experience gained in the senior team will help during the FIFA under-20 World Cup in South Korea in May. "It has been a great team for all of us. The spirit was very high in the camp and the senior players led by example. Getting a start yesterday, I was very happy and excited to get the first game for Bafana and I think I did well as an individual and we did well as a team as well, said striker Luther Singh. The main focus for the senior team is to prepare for the crunch Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Nigeria in June. The Bafana Bafana coaching saga remains unresolved after months of speculation. The association said the matter is near conclusion.
