After the cabinet was reshuffled by President Jacob Zuma two weeks ago, many residents of South Africa voiced their concerns about the reshuffling. Democratic Alliance (DA), Save South Africa and ordinary people took marches of no hope to the president in the different cities of the country, demanding him to step down. On Saturday, the deputy president of African National Congress women's League (ANCWL), Sisi Ntombela told a hall full of residents that Jacob Zuma will remain a president of South Africa until 2019. Ntombela said, last week s was a sign that whites were still ready to fight black people. "I have never saw such bad behaviour shown by our compatriots while the whites leading them. That was a simple show that, critism is still taking place in the country", said Ntombela. "My black brothers and sisters were used by the whites to show no respect to President Jacob Zuma," she continued. She further mentioned several incidents happened in the country over the couple of days including when a man was dragged on a car.
