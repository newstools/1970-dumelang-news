Toyota Cheetahs are looking to get their Super Rugby tour off to a positive start this weekend, but will have a mountain to climb as they face the on-form Blues side in Wellington, in New Zealand on Friday. Kickoff at the Eden Park is at 09:35 (CAT). Following disappointments endured last week against the Highlanders in their last match, the Cheetahs, who arrived in New Zealand on Sunday, will have their work cut out as they seek to rectify their mistakes. The men from Bloemfontein were denied victory in the last five minutes of the match against the Highlanders as the visitors slotted three quick tries to win the match 45-41, much to the disappointments of those associated with the orange and white outfit. However, this week against the Blues, who won their last two matches, the Cheetahs will be looking to be more clinical and coach, Franco Smith would be hoping the retained squad correct the mistakes. Smith made a few swaps upfront, with Charles Marais coming in for Ox Nche at loose-head prop while the injured Paul Schoeman is replaced by Neill Jordaan at flank. It was the Cheetahs eighth straight loss in ten matches, and they have last tasted a win back in March, at home against the Sunwolves. They now lie at the seventh spot on the South African conference with 11 points and two wins.
