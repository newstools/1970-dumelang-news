Depp sued The Management Group in January for $25 million, alleging fraud and negligence. He also accused the L.A.-based firm, run by brothers Joel Mandel and Rob Mandel, of failing to file his taxes on time and taking out high-interest loans on his behalf. Depp claimed that TMG led him to be more than $40 million in debt. In a countersuit, the actor's ex-managers cited Depp's lavish lifestyle as the cause of his financial downfall. "Depp lived an ultra-extravagant lifestyle that often knowingly cost Depp in excess of $2 million per month to maintain, which he simply could not afford," the Mandel brothers' attorney, Michael Kump, wrote in the cross-complaint. "Depp, and Depp alone, is fully responsible for any financial turmoil he finds himself in today." Depp is seeking $25 million in damages for fraud and negligence. The actor also cited his right to spend his money however he sees fit. "It's my money," Depp said. "If I want to buy 15,000 cotton balls a day, it's my thing." The actor also claimed that the Mandel brothers lied about certain aspects of the countersuit related to his 14 homes, as well as $18 million allegedly spent on a luxury yacht and $30,000 per month on wine. "Depp also paid over $3 million to blast from a specially-made cannon the ashes of author Hunter Thompson over Aspen, Co.," Kump wrote in cross-complaint. Depp challenged that figure, telling The Wall Street Journal that the cannon actually cost $5 million. The Mandel Company has demanded a trial by jury on all issues. In response to countersuit, Depp's lawyer issued a statement in January: "How cataloguing alleged spending by Mr. Depp of his own money could somehow absolve the defendants of their large and multi-faceted mosaic of wrongdoing will ultimately be determined by the court."
