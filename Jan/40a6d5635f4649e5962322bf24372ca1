The National Education Health &amp; Allied Workers Union [NEHAWU] confirmed that it has signed a settlement agreement with the Department of Social Development on Friday, 14 April,after lengthy and difficult marathon negotiations. NEHAWU has since suspended the strike which has lasted more than five weeks. The Union s spokesperson, Khaya Xaba, says they however, still need to conclude negotiations in the Bargaining Council with regard to the Rural Allowance and the Review of Occupational Specific Dispensation. He says although employees are expected to soon report for duty, the strike will only be called off once final conclusions have been reached at the Bargaining Council. Workers are expected to return to work on Friday April 14, 2017 for those who work shifts and other employees will return on Tuesday April 18, 2017.A task team consisting of both NEHAWU and the employer is established to monitor the implementation of the agreement and ensure swift resolution of challenges which may arise. Both NEHAWU and the employer agreed that there will be cessation of hostilities and that no worker will be a victim of punitive measures by the employer for participating in the strike. The Department also made a commitment to reverse all deductions that have already been effected on some workers. Xaba says the settlement includes that the employer is to table a detailed offer and proposals on their demands on or before 31st July 2017 in the Bargaining Council, back pay on the introduction of Rural Allowance will be with effect from 01st April 2017, back pay on reviewed and improved salary levels and other inherent benefits of a packaged OSD model will be with effect from 01 October 2017.
