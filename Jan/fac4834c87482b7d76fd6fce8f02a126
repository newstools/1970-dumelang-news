After spending five years living in squalor conditions at the Monontsha Village in Qwaqwa, grandmother Elinah Nkosi (54) was overjoyed to receive the house built for her and her family by the Department of Cooperatives and Traditional Affairs in the Free State, on Saturday. Nkosi is the mother of seven children, all of whom depend on her for their livelihood, even though four of them were not living with her. Nkosi lived with her three children aged 23, 18 and 12 years old. She could not contain her happiness when she was presented with the keys to her newly built and furnished house. Nkosi said she had lost hope when her previous mud house had collapsed in the heavy rains that hit the Eastern Free State in 2012, leaving her family homeless. I have no words to express how elated I am because I've been struggling to live in the squatters and was praying for a better house for the past five years. My wish is that the government extends their helping hand to other needy people like me as I have realised that our problems are understood by the leaders, said Nkosi. The Acting Executive Mayor, Masetjhaba Mosia-Lakaje, said as a responsible Maluti-A-Phofung Municipality they had to restore hope by building Granny Nkosi a house that would give her dignity back. "Our intention is to ensure that our people live in the adequate living conditions. We had heard of their disaster and found that we must notify Cogta, to see if there's something they can help with. Today we are here to celebrate their new house together with them ," said Mosia-Lakaje.
