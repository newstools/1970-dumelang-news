Hurricane Matthew, the fiercest Caribbean storm in nearly a decade, slammed into the Bahamas early on Thursday and intensified as it barrelled toward the south-eastern US coast where millions of residents heeded warnings to flee inland. Roadways in Florida, Georgia and North and South Carolina were jammed and gas stations and food stores ran out of supplies as the storm approached, bringing storm surges, heavy rain and sustained winds that accelerated overnight to about 125 miles (205 km) per hour. Matthew, which killed at least 39 people and displaced thousands, mostly in southern Haiti, was predicted to strengthen from a Category 3 to 4 storm en route to Florida's Atlantic coast. Landfall was expected there on Thursday night, the US National Hurricane Centre said.The centre extended its hurricane warning area farther north into Georgia and more than 12 million US residents were under a hurricane watches and warnings, according to the Weather Channel.
