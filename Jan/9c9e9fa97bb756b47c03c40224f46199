"The body is badly burnt. Her mother is traumatised. She doesn't talk, and it s very difficult for her." DNA tests will be conducted on a body believed to be that of a missing Soweto woman, Karabo Mokoena. The body was discovered in a veld in Lindhurst, North of Johannesburg, two weeks ago and a 27-year-old man has been arrested. A shattered family, the Mokoena's left the Sandton Police Station where the alleged killer is been held with shock and disbelief. Family member, Tshepo Mokoena, says, "The body is badly burnt. Her mother is traumatised. She doesn't talk, and it s very difficult for her." The 22-year-old went missing on the 28th of April. The case has sparked an outcry on social media. Mokoena's ID document was found in a Sandton flat where it's believed her boyfriend lived. The body was allegedly placed in a pikitup bin and dumped. Tshepo Mokoena says, "The parents contacted the boyfriend to ask about her. But he said he hasn't seen the girl in a long time. We were so sure it was not him until the early hours of the morning when he confessed it was him." The body was kept in a mortuary, as the victim's identity was unknown. Captain Mavela Masondo says, "We have started with our DNA tests and that will help us to confirm if this is the real body of the deceased." Anger and shock was vented on social media and the spotlight again thrown on gender violence. The suspects will appear at the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court on Friday.
