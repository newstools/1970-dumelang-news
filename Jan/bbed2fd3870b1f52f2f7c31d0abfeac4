THEUNISSEN- Residents and businesses of Theunissen/Masilo are advised of the latest update on the interruption of water supply scheduled between 06h00 and 20h00 on Tuesday, 11th October 2016, due to routine maintenance at the Theunissen Water Treatment Works. The community is therefore advised that the routine maintenance has overran its scheduled period and as a result residents can expect sufficient water supply particularly in the high laying areas from Friday, 14th October 2016, whereas the low laying areas will start to experience water supply from tomorrow Thursday, 13th October 2016.During this period the community is urged to use water sparingly and for household use only. The usage of water for watering of gardens and washing of cars is therefore prohibited. In addition, the community is also urged to be mindful of the drought situation affecting many of water sources in the country including the municipality and to a notice issued to the municipality by Sand-Vet Water Users Association, to restrict Bulk Raw Water supply by 40% effective from the 29th February 2016. This was subsequent to the Government Gazette Notice No. 39679 by the Director General of the Department of Water and Sanitation. These restrictions have had an adverse effect on our water supply particularly in the high laying areas.The municipality will, however, continuously supply portable water through water tanks to the community in strategic key points which are known to the community and other key water users such as clinics and schools. Contrary to the information currently doing rounds, residents and businesses are urged to take note that this interruption is not as result of electricity cut by Eskom to the water treatment works but rather to the over running period of routine maintenance, hence this update is subsequent to an earlier notice issued on Friday, 07th October 2016.
