 Yesterday an act of terrorism tried to silence our democracy. But today we meet as normal, as generations have done before us and as future generations will continue to do, to deliver a simple message: we are not afraid and our resolve will never waver in the face of terrorism. And we meet here in the oldest of all parliaments because we know democracy and the values it entails will always prevail, said Prime Minister Theresa May. May said yesterday, parliament and the UK would not be cowed by the attacks, and the public would continue with their daily life. Let this be the message from this house and this nation today: our values will prevail , she said.The news that the London attacker was born in Britain and inspired by extremist Islamist ideology was entirely predictable, as was his criminal record. The standout detail from the sketchy profile we have of Khalid Masood is his age: 52, nearly twice that of most contemporary attackers. The attack was claimed yesterday by Islamic State. The group has been selective with such statements, which are credible, and careful in its vocabulary. Significantly, Isis described a soldier who responded to its call , indicating the group probably did not have prior contact with Masood before the killings. A suspected terrorist plowed a car into pedestrians on London's Westminster Bridge on Wednesday afternoon, then fatally stabbed a police officer before being shot. Police said about 29 other people were being treated in hospital, seven of who were is a severe condition. Police made 8 further arrests subsequent to naming the attacker.
