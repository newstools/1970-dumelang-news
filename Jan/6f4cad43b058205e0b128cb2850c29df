All time rivals, South Africa and New Zealand have been drawn in the same pool following a Rugby World Cup draw conducted during the week in Japan. The two nations, who have met four times in the Rugby World Cup before, will be joined by three more teams in Pool B for the much anticipated World Cup to be held in Japan in 2019. The tournament will consist of four pools, with five teams on each. The hosts are joined by Scotland and Ireland in Pool A while England, France and Argentina will battle in pool C. The two-time winning side, Australia were drawn with Wales and Georgia are in Pool D. Italy will join the defending champions, the All Blacks and the seventh-placed side, the Springboks in Pool B. Speaking after the draw, the Boks coach Allister Coetzee said hard word and preparations began long ago. We ve been working hard since arriving back from the 2016 Castle Lager outgoing tour to ensure improved results from now on forward, with the Rugby World Cup on the distant horizon, If ever there was testimony that the gap between the top teams have closed, then we saw that over the past few months in the Northern Hemisphere. With New Zealand established as the number one side, there is also a very little to choose between the top sides in the world, while the next batch of teams continue to improve, he said. The ninth edition of the prestigious showpiece will be held for the first time in Asia and will take place from 20 September until 02 November.
