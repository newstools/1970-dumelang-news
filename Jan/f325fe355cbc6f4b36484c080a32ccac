The SuperSport coach will meanwhile, continue to fulfill his coaching responsibilities at the club for the remaining four Absa Premiership fixtures as well as the Nedbank Cup and Confederation Cup.Safa and SuperSport have agreed to work together to ensure that the Baxter gets time off post the final league match on 27 May to prepare Bafana Bafana for the upcoming Afcon match against Nigeria. SuperSport United CEO Stanley Matthews wished Baxter the best of luck for his second term as Bafana Bafana head coach, but stressed that the focus right now is still on SuperSport retaining the Nedbank Cup and finishing in the Top Four of the League. We obviously did not want to lose Stuart as our Coach. He has done a great job in getting us to the competitive level we expect as a Club, however, we also understand that Stuart would like to have a final go at competing at a Fifa World Cup and that would be a fantastic achievement for the country as a whole, said Matthews.
