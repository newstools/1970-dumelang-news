QWAQWA - Spirited Executive mayor of the Maluti-a-Phofung Local Municipality, Vusi Tshabalala, is expected to talk about some of the challenges that the local municipality is faced with during this year s State of the Municipal Address (SOMA). The SOMA event is scheduled to take place at the Makwane stadium outside Puthaditjhaba in Qwaqwa on Tuesday morning. Scores of people from within the municipality and a few dignitaries from the neighbouring towns are expected to show up at the event to listen to the executive mayor s address.Among some of the things that the community will be hoping to hear from the address is the on-going water problem that saw the community going without running water for almost two years now. Few areas have had the privilege of receiving water from their taps in the past few months but others, especially those in the remote rural areas, have been relying on water trucks. Moeketsi Lebesa, the president of the Dikwankwetla Party of South Africa (DPSA) - the one of the opposition parties in Maluti-a-Phofung - said they were expecting the executive mayor to announce that the municipality will increase spending on core functions and curb spending on non-core functions. Increase spending on infrastructure development, more especially water, electricity, sanitation and roads. We need to strengthen our oversight role, our internal audit processes as well as our supply chain management processes, he said. Lebesa said they also expect him to address the water crisis. We want to know what the municipality is doing to mitigate the current water crisis and what plans they have to attend to that, Lebesa said.
