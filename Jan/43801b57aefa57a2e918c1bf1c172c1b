His fans simply cannot get enough of him and are glued to their TV sets whenever he appears on soapies such as Gold Diggers and Broken Vows. Moloi has appeared on a number of TV dramas including Muvhango, Rockville and many others, also being featured in movies such as Spud, Attack on Darfur, Mrs Right Guy and Wild at Heart. In an exclusive interview with Dumelang News, Moloi said he immersed himself into the characters that he played in order to make his performance as believable as possible. Moloi currently plays the role of Lebo on Broken Vows which airs on eTV at 8pm from Mondays until Fridays. Unlike his gangster character on Gold Diggers, Lebo is a smooth and slick someone who is always in muscle tops to show-off his bulging biceps. He s a real ladies man. I started acting in 1993 while I was still a primary learner in Welkom. I have always liked acting as I would perform in school sketches to the amusement of teachers and fellow learners. One thing I can promise you is that there is going to be a lot of drama in the coming episodes, said Moloi. He said he was going to develope his acting skills so that he could someday star in Hollywood movies like other well-known South Africans who have made their mark in Hollywood such as Charlize Theron, Pearl Thusi, Terry Pheto and Fana Mokoena. Moloi said young people should follow their dreams and study hard at school because nothing was guaranteed under the sun.
