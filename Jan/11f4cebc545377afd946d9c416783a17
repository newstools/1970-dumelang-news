BLOEMFONTEIN-Free State will be hosting the next under-12 Danone Nations Cup provincial final tomorrow (Saturday, April 22) at Grey College in Bloemfontein. There will be five regional final winners competing for a place in the national finals happening in Gauteng on 1 July this year. Zamaleka Primary School of Villiers qualified to represent Fezile Dabi this past weekend after ending top of the log in their regional finals. It took six attempts for the school to reach the provincials and the team s coach, Joseph Mphuthi, believes the insight into the game that he has gained by obtaining a SAFA D license coaching qualification last year has a lot to do with their success. I learnt about various technical and tactical aspects of youth football including the psychology behind teaching kids, said Mphuthi. The emphasis in the course was on the various passing skills and how to create shooting opportunities, he said. You need to be extra patient with young players. They all develop differently and at different times. There are those who catch on quickly and those that need more time. I come from a high school teaching background and working with primary school kids is very different. Mphuti took over the team when he started working at the school in 2015. He has been teaching for 15 years and has coached under-15, under-17 and open teams before. The preparations for this year s tournament started in August 2016. It was that extra practice that helped us reach the provincial finals. It gave me time to rectify the mistakes that the players were making before the cluster level games began. Attending the coaching training last year has definitely equipped him as a coach, he believes. Some knowledge of the theory of coaching is needed when it comes to coaching a team especially the young ones who are new to the game, added Mphuti.
