BETHLEHEM- A 60year old man, Johannes Mahlaku, of De Hoek Farm near Bethlehem died after allegedly being knocked down by a 34-year-old farmer on Friday 7 October 2016 at neighbouring Stillewoning Farm. Josef Van Eeden is alleged to have chased Mahlaku in his car until he knocked him down. The deceased, an employee at De Hoek, is said to have been collecting leftover maize following a harvest at Stillewoning. He was taken to Dihlabeng Hospital in Bethlehem where he succumbed to injuries a day later. The suspect was arrested and briefly appeared before Bethlehem Magistrates Court on 11 October. His case was postponed for bail application. Van Eeden is also scheduled to appear before the Fouriesburg Magistrates Court in November this year charged for a separate murder case. He is alleged to have shot and killed Babiki Abraham Mokoena (33) whom he suspected of stock theft on 7 December 2015.
