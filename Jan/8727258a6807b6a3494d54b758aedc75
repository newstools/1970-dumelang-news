Ingredientsa leg of lamb (about 2.3 kg) 1 large onion, roughly chopped a few sprigs of fresh roesmary 2 cloves of garlic 1 Tbs sea salt flakes a pinch of sweet paprika 1 Tbs cumin seeds 2 Tbs thyme leaves 2 Tbs olive oil a thick slice of butterMethod Pre-heat the oven to 160C and start making the spice rub. Peel the garlic cloves and lightly crush them together with the salt using a pestle and mortar. Add the paprika, cumin seeds and thyme leaves. Gradually add the oil so as to end up with a thickish paste. Melt the butter in a small pan and stir into the spce paste. Put the lamb in a casserole dish or roasting tin and rub it all over with the spice paste. I don t mind getting my hands dirty but if you are squeamish you can use the back of a spoon. make a few holes in the flesh with a skewer and insert sprigs of rosemary. Scatter the chopped onion around the meat and put the roasting tin in the oven for 35 minutes uncovered. Pour in 250ml water and baste the meat with the liquid, then continue roasting for a further three hours, basting the meat every hour with the juices that have collected in the bottom of the pan. After 3 hours, remove the pan from the oven and pour off the top layer of oil that has collected, leaving the cloudy, herby sediment. Cover the pan with a lid and set aside for ten minutes to rest. Carve the lamb and serve with chickpea mash, spooning the pan juices over both as you go.
