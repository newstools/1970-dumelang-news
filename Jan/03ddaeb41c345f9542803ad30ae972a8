An Issa Sarr header in additional time saved a point for Orlando Pirates against Baroka FC in an Absa Premiership match at Orlando Stadium in Soweto on Wednesday night. The 1-all result was mirrored in the other match between Platinum Stars and Free State Stars at the Moruleng Stadium in North West. With just under 13 minutes to play Baroka, who had placed the Bucs under pressure throughout, found the opener through substitute Sepana Letsoalo. Pirates drew level in the final minute of injury time when a right-flank cross found the head of Sarr, who powered an effort beyond the reach of Oscarine Masuluke. Just outside of Rustenburg, in the tenth minute, Platinum Stars took the lead against Free State Stars when Henrico Botes headed home an inch perfect cross from Gerald Phiri, 1-0.Free State, though, were not to be behind for long with Nhlanhla Vilakazi found the equaliser eight minutes later courtesy of a neat curling shot from just outside the box.
