Coach, Burta de Kock praised the defence, saying it played a huge role in the Free State Crinums opening wins of the Brutal Fruit Netball Premier League in Cape Town recently. De Kock and her charges got the season off to a sour start with losses in the first three matches, but was confident they would turn the season around. Our defence is improving every week and I m also very excited that for the first time, I have three shooters who are prepared to shoot from anywhere in the circle, said De Kock. Wins over the Eastern Cape Aloes (63-36) and the Kingdom Stars (52-32) ensured the ladies from the City of Roses end their winless record as they seek to replica their last year s performance. The Crinums was also thrilled with the return to action of their captain, Maryka Holtzhausen, who was sidelined for almost eight-months owing to injury. Holtzhausen undoubtedly brought an impressive pace and spirit within the team, something de Kock also commended. We have to try out our combinations including Maryka. Some of the players haven t played with her before, de Kock said. She added: I m very excited by the three 18-year-olds I played this weekend Lefebre Rademan, Luscha Pienaar and Meagan Roux. They all stepped up to the plate and the senior players will know they ve got to work to keep their places in the team. The BFPNL moves to the Bellville Velodrome next weekend.
