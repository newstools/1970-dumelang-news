The staff and employees of Thabo Mofutsanyana district municipality (TMDM) took their time to clean their workplace on Friday. The district office previously known as an old parliament was like a construction zone. The district's executive mayor,Malefu Vilakazi told Dumelang News that charity starts at home. Vilakazi said this is an instruction set by the state's president Jacob Zuma. "This is a program that will take place every Friday in the different municipalities around the district." She said they follow the legacy of the late former country's president Nelson Mandela. "We'll spend our 67 minutes by changing the lives of other residents in every Friday." She added that the campaign will also include helping old men, women and people living with disability by cleaning at their homes. "We have done it before and we'll keep on doing it for our residents", she said. She warned people to stop pounding everywhere in the villages. "Our areas must be kept clean. Our parents and grand-parents must be well treated", she concluded. Lebohang Motsoeneng (51), an employee in the TMDM,was happy to work outside the office. She said working with their leaders gave them enough hope that there's an affirmative action at work. "The executive mayor and other seniors lead us by example. And that gives us a lot of strength to see them working with us in the garden", said Lebohang. She said they will ensure that other people's lives are changed from better to the best.
