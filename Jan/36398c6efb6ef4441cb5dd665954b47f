Living up to all expectations, Bonolo set the stage on fire with her Sesotho influenced Jazz music at the Bloem-show on Sunday. She graced the stage just before the legendary Ringo Madlingozi wrapped up the show with his explosive live performance. Bonolo said she has performed all over South Africa and in the other countries neighbouring South Africa especially Botswana, Lesotho and Zimbabwe. She said the actual record sales were not that big, but she was not complaining because her performances had been bringing her close to her fans that enjoy her music. Bonolo is also working on a new album, but has not decided on a name for it yet. My album is selling very slow, its moving like a tortoise, but I have been booked for many shows.I always have stage fright, but when I start performing I become something else. I enjoyed performing for my fans. I m working on a new album but I m not going to collaborate with anyone for this one, said Bonolo. She said her upcoming album was going to be more mature and would explore other sounds. Many people enjoyed the day event as they danced and sang along to the music of Bonolo who is cementing her repertoire as the force to be reckoned with in the Afro-Jazz music scene. Other performers on the day were Bongani Khanuka, Sweet Memories, Thembisile K, Thoko Nogabe and Ringo who was the last musician to perform at the well attended Jazz show.
