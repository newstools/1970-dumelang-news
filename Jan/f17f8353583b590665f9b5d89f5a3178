DURBAN - The Mayor of Ngwathe Local Municipality, Joey Mochela, recently led a municipal delegation to the 87th Institute of Municipal Finance Officers (IMFO) Conference held from October 3 to October 5, at the Durban International Convention Centre, where the local authority was honoured with a Clean Administration Award. It gives me great pleasure to be accepting the Clean Administration Award, remember, Ngwathe Municipality has achieved an unqualified audit opinion for 2014/15 financial year and this milestone emphasises that the municipality under the ANC leadership is effectively managing public funds while improving and accelerating service delivery, said Mochela.The 2016 instalment of the IMFO Conference is aptly themed: 'Sustaining Municipal Viability amidst Economic Distress.' According to the mayor, the award will go a long way in ensuring that her municipality continues to improve on its administration while being robust on revenue collection and be conscious of expenditure. We are also rolling out indigent verification and registration process where our officials are going to the townships to confirm the indigent status of our people and the data thereof will also assist us in making proper financial decisions while profiling our residents so as to deal with the economic distress at hand. The action plan has been developed to ensure that every manager is psyched towards improved performance, empowering junior staff to handle daily duties with positivity and diligence, continuation with same consultants on AFS compilation as well as turning around strategy as they also assist in the skills transfer to ensure that an internal capacity with clearer oversight is build. On the political side, the new MMC for Finance, Masetshego Mofokeng, has been tasked with ensuring that there is a common goal between the political and the administrative side of the municipality so as to maintain and sustain the unqualified audit status while pushing for a clean audit. A humble word of gratitude to our external stakeholders and government departments who played a meaningful role and contributed progressively to our achievements," said the mayor Mochela.
