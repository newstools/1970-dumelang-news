The absolute success of the ASA track and field and combined events championships has made an unmistaken statement that South African athletics is back, focussed and hungry to take on the world. All our six Olympic finalists from Rio 2016 gave incredible performances and we must not be ashamed to pat ourselves on the back as an athletics family for a job well done, said Aleck Skhosana, the President of Athletics South Africa. Long Jump Olympic silver medallist Luvo Manyonga was the most successful story of the Championship, breaking his African record for the second time this season by three centimetres. Simbine who clocked 9.94 in the semis , crossed the line in 9.95 in the final, followed by Olympic 400m champion Wayde van Niekerk (10.04). Van Niekerk cemented his intentions on a World Champs double when he won the 200m on Saturday in 19.90, crossing the line 0.25 ahead of Simbine to revenge his defeat in the 100m and missing Jobodwana s national record by 0.03. Rio Olympic 800m gold medalist Caster Semenya Caster Semenya successfully defended her SA 400m (51.60), and 800m (2:01.03) titles, winning both finals less than two hours apart. These are indeed exciting times for South African athletics and the current indication is that our prospects are looking bright in London when we take on the World Champs in August. What made us happiest is the positive attitude and maturity of athletes in the way they expressed pride of the national flag and understanding that they are the primary drivers of the country s athletics , said Skhosana.
