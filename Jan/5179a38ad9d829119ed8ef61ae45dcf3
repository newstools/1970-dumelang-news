The Premier Soccer League s Dispute Resolution Committee handed down the judgement and has ordered coach Luc Eymael to return to his former employers, Polokwane City. Eymael made headlines with his sudden move to Siwelele earlier last month - a day after quitting Rise and Shine. The Belgian was then prevented from taking his place on the bench following the pending dispute, in which the Citizens were demanding R2.8 million in compensation for his services. With Eymael set to return to Limpopo, it is unclear as to whether the green and white outfit will bring in a new mentor or stick with the caretaker coach, Lehlohonolo Seema. However, Celtic CEO, Khumbulani Konco, said they might go the legal route and appeal the decision taken by the DRC. "We re still studying the document and will revert back on what options to go forward with, Konco said. He added: One of them is that we can appeal the decision taken by the DRC. I think we have seven days to appeal, but I ll have to confirm with our lawyers. Meanwhile, Celtic are preparing to face Orlando Pirates in the Nedbank Cup quarterfinal on Saturday, hoping to frustrate yet another Gauteng giant after playing to a goalless stalemate with Mamelodi Sundowns weeks ago. kickoff at Orlando Stadium is at 8:30pm.
