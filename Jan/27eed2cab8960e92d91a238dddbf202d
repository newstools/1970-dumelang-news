Free State premier Ace Magashule, told President Jacob Zuma that the Free State is behind him and remains unshaken. The statement was made on Tuesday during an address at the launch of the Maluti-a-Phofung Special Economic Zone (MAP-SEZ) near Harrismith. President be strong, the nation is behind you. This is a time when the nation needs the president more than before. We want to tell you that our province is behind you and we will forever remain loyal to you, Magashule said. He said they supported Zuma because they felt that he was one of the presidents who listened to the people. It was only during the time of president Zuma that we took the economy in our own hands and we will never be apologetic for that, he said. Magashule s response was as a result of the recent attacks on Zuma with many people and unions calling for the head of the president. MEC SamMashinini emphasised the point made by the premier that they were behind the president and added that they would not retreat on that. He further warned the president to keep an eye on those people who have turned their back on him.
