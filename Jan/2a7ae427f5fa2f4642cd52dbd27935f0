Twenty-three-year-old Mamokete Pete from the Mabolela Village of Qwaqwa is one young lady with big dreams, strong ambition and a powerful drive. Every morning, she wakes up at 5am to set off on a 10km journey to a main road in Phuthaditjhaba, where remains for the rest of the day, displaying a placard requesting financial assistance to further her studies. Mamokete lives with her mother who earns around R600 at the (EPWP) Extended Public Works Programme at the Maluti-a-Phofung Local Municipality. And while this amount may help to put food on the table to feed herself, her mother and her younger brother, it cannot help the young lady achieve her life's goals. That goal is to be a paramedic, to save lives and to help her family out of their dire situation.Mamokete completed her matric in 2014 at the Thokoana Makaota Secondary School. She has since had no luck acquiring the financial assistance she needs to further her studies. I am not ashamed to be standing on the road because I know what I want. I need money to study Basic Ambulance Assistance, she said. She said she wanted to study that because she has passion for it and she would love to help other people especially those in accidents who need that assistance to save their lives. My mother is doing everything she can to make us happy but there are some things she cannot make possible. I was raised by her as a single mother since I grew up not knowing who my father was, she said. Mamokete said she had tried all other avenues, but even when all efforts went in vain, she was determined to not give up and took to the road to seek a miracle in the likes of a passerby. She said she was hoping God will send a Good Samaritan who will help her as soon as possible. I will do this until someone sees me and helps, she said.
