The Southern Stings achieved a comprehensive 45-35 win over the defending champions, the Free State Crinums, in their Brutal Fruit Netball Premier League (BFNPL) match. The Stings had the edge over the Crinums throughout the match, but it was only in the final quarter that they were able to cut loose and put some distance between their scores. Until then, they were always only two or three goals ahead. I m really proud of the girls, said Stings coach Annelie Lucas. We let them put us under pressure a bit but then we came back. I am also very pleased that we seem to have depth in our shooters, Vanes-Mari (Du Toit) had to come off early in the first quarter, but our young shooters really did well. I had been reluctant to play Danelle Lochner, because she used to play for the Crinums, but I put her on and she and Helene Steyn tore their defence apart. We need more consistency in the circle, said Crinums coach Burta de Kock. The girls need to work hard again during the week we ve lost three matches now and we can t afford to lose any more.
