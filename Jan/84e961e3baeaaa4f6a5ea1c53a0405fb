JOHANNESBURG - Cosatu marched to Absa's headquarters on Thursday and asked the bank to pay back to R2.5-billion bailout it got from the Reserve Bank during the apartheid era. Cosatu's additional reason for its demonstration is that it accuses Absa of charging exorbitant banking fees and says this should stop. The labour federation also wants the bank to come clear on reports that it is involved in collusion with two other South African banks and several international institutions. The Competition Commission on Wednesday said it has been investigating a case of price-fixing and market allocation in the trading of foreign currency pairs involving the rand since April 2015. Cosatu handed over a memorandum with their demands to a representative from Absa The federation has given the bank two days to respond or face losing some of its customers. Absa, meanwhile has hit back at Cosatu for saying it symbolises what's wrong with the economy. The bank says much of the good work it does across the continent, is being ignored. "Our contribution is significant - we employ and pay billions in taxes," said Absa Spokesperson, Songezo Zibi. The case has been referred to the tribunal for prosecution. Meanwhile, the Competition Commission has added new complaints against 18 banking entities outlining further offences that Standard New York and the Bank of America allegedly committed while rigging the rand-dollar exchange market.
