Westonaria - President Jacob Zuma says agriculture is one of the powerful tools that can unearth jobs and realise the goal of radical socio-economic transformation. Addressing dozens of residents in the West Rand at the Westonaria Agri-Parks on Tuesday, President Zuma said government wants to bring approximately 300 000 new smallholder farmers into the agricultural sector and to create 145 000 new agro-processing jobs through the Agri-Parks Programme. The programme is also aimed at bringing one million hectares of land into production. The intention of the Agri-parks Programme is to ensure that farmers own at least 70% of the wealth creation opportunities created by the programme. We look up to the agricultural sector to create more jobs for our people, said President Zuma. He said Agri-Parks are part of government s drive to radically transform the South African economy so that millions of African people, including women, youth and people with disabilities, are brought into productive activities and ownership within the mainstream economy. The key pillars of the programme include supporting producers and helping them to get markets to sell their produce. It is also about fast tracking land reform. The Department of Rural Development and Land Reform, in partnership with the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and other spheres of government, is rolling out the Agri-Parks Programme to all 44 districts in the country. We want to see the Agri-Parks Programme contributing to the growth and development of the economy. We remain resolute in our commitment to build a better South Africa and create opportunities for all of our people, said the President.
