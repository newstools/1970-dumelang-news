BLOEMFONTEIN - What started out as a peaceful, academic day at the Central University of Technology (CUT) campus in Bloemfontein later turned ugly when police had to shoot stun grenades and rubber bullets at protesting students. Earlier on Monday at the CUT, students evacuated the lecture halls, student support centre and the library due to a fire that broke out at the male toilets behind the Amphitheatre. The fire was caused by unknown individuals which the security guards suspect were not students of the institution. The SAPS and the fire department were quickly called to the scene to try and control the situation. As the afternoon wore on, students were shot at for throwing bricks and stones at police vehicles. Two students were later arrested for throwing bricks at the police. The SRC president, Thapelo Ngozo, had no idea of what was happening at the campus because he was at court in support of six other students who were arrested last week. All students were released on warnings. There is nothing I can do for you right now except listen to your concerns and see if I can help where I can said Professor Henk De Jager. The students gave the SAPS an ultimatum to release the two students and stop those who were writing exams or else they were going to take matters into their own hands. Nobody wants to wake up to protest and get arrested but what can we say, the end justifies the means, explained Netty Ramatlama, a Language Practice student at the campus.
