SABC Board Chairperson Khanyisile Kweyama says they've set up several committees to resolve the crisis at the public broadcaster. She is confident that the board will turn the situation around at the SABC. The broadcaster has admitted it is under financial stress. Kweyama says a lot of work awaits them but they are up to the task. We are now a properly constituted board with all the board committees and we are now getting into how to turn around this corporation. I guess it's public knowledge that the situation is bad and it also just gives us a wake-up call so that we don't think that it's something that's going to happen overnight, when you realise the gravity of the situation then you know that you need to put your shoulder to the wheel and to get working. Meanwhile, Kweyama says staffers will receive their April salaries.The SABC reportedly only has about R70 million in its reserve fund which is insufficient to pay staff and run the organisation. Further the new SABC board is taking action to scrap the widely ridiculed decision to make all broadcast content 90% local, after it had undermined the entire business of the public broadcaster, The Post newspaper reports. According to the report, citing board member Krish Naidoo, a meeting was scheduled and overturning the decision was an item for discussion on the agenda. Naidoo said that should the board agree, the system would probably revert to the previous quota, which was 60% local content. He noted that this was due to the fact that the 90% local quota was never an official policy, meaning the board could reconsider it. It impacted on the entire revenue stream. Both listeners and advertising dropped, likely as a consequence of 90:10, Naidoo said.
