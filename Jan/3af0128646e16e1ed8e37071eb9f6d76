The Democratic Alliance's (DA) Federal Legal Commission said they are expecting to hear from the legal advisor of Western Cape Premier, Helen Zille, this week. She faces charges of bringing the party into disrepute, following her recent tweets relating to colonialism. Zille has been issued with a charge sheet by the party's Federal Executive after tweets that seemingly defended colonialism. The charges are bringing the party into disrepute and also damaging it. Chairperson of the Federal Legal Commission, Glynnis Breytenbach, said they will soon decide on a date for Zille's disciplinary hearing. She's in possession of the charge sheet. She's appointed a firm of attorneys to represent her and they are currently consulting. As soon as they have clear idea of where they stand, they will get in touch with us and we will arrange dates. (It) should be in the course of this week. In a separate matter, Cape Town Mayor, Patricia de Lille is also currently being investigated, for allegedly leaking internal party documents. The party's federal legal council is dealing with both matters.
