ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa has slammed Northern Cape Premier Sylvia Lucas for reshuffling her cabinet without consulting the party s provincial leadership earlier this week. "The ANC notes with disbelief actions of the Northern Cape Premier to reshuffle her cabinet without any consultation with the ANC," Kodwa said on Thursday, 11 May, in Colesberg. We view this as a flagrant abuse of her office to further divide the ANC and undermine unity of the organisation. Her unbridled arrogance is a betrayal of trust with the ANC - the organisation that deployed her as Premier, he added. Lucas changed her executive on Wednesday, 10 May, on the eve of the provincial elective conference this weekend. The premier moved ten MECs and fired two.Lucas is contesting the post of provincial ANC chairperson against Secretary Zamani Saul, who is expected to win. Lucas is also the Northern Cape ANC treasurer. Kodwa said consultation with the ANC structures on matters of deployment is a principle of the organisation and not a favour . He further warned deployees to desist from misusing their deployment to deepen divisions in the ANC. The ANC in the Northern Cape released a harsh statement on Wednesday saying it was "disgusted" by the reshuffle, about which Lucas had failed to consult the party and its allies. Saul said the reshuffle entangled the government in party politics. The secretary said the reshuffling had nothing to do with improving service delivery but everything with influencing the outcome of the conference. "This is grossly irresponsible, reckless and self-serving. This tact is fallacious and deeply entangles the provincial government in the organisational politics of the ANC," he added. They opposed the reshuffle, he warned."This was done with total disregard of the ANC internal processes, which require thorough consultation with the ANC and the alliance partners. We therefore don t take kindly to this conduct by the premier and there will be consequences," Saul said.
