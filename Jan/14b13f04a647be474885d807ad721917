The Maluti-A-Phofung invited motivational speaker Dr. David Molapo and his wife Mamikie from I Can Foundation to inspire the 2017 matriculants. The motivational talks which were well received were held in Bluegumbosch and Clubview Secondary school on 18 April, with the purpose of engaging the students about their daily academic challenges and how they could overcome them. In one of his motivational talks Molapo said the matriculants needed to work hard at the colleges and universities so that they could pave a successful life for themselves and their families. Positive mind and focus through your vision you will never go wrong, taking into cognisance that this year s leading theme is, I can, you can, and together we can make this country a better place, said Molapo.The municipality also used the platform to assist pupils who needed assistance with online applications for various institutions of higher learning and the availability of bursaries, internships, learnerships and scholarships within the municipality as well as other institutions. Moloi Velaphe, one of the Grade 12 students at Bluegumbosch Secondary School said he used to have a low self-esteem but after the motivational talks he felt like a changed person. The motivational programme will continue to cater all the MAP schools at large until 05th of May 2017.
