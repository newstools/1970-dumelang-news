The food which was meant for Zama zamas was confiscated before it could reach it owners underground. Food, drinks, alcohol, biltong and cigarettes meant to be sent to the Zama Zamas were taken away by the Hawks team after they received a tip off over the weekend in Welkom. Hawks spokesman Captain Philani Nkwalase said the hawks had been keeping an eye to the movements in and around Welkom for some time and had known when the carefully wrapped food would be dispatched from the place of hiding to Zama Zamas.He said that five people were arrested for the cache before it could be delivered to the Zama zamas who mine gold illegally in the mines and closed mines. NKwelase said Zwelandile Mpalampela (48), Zukisani Stemele (26), Thuso Ntuli (51), Hlathi Zawe (61) and Bongani Stone (38) were charged with illegal mining, conspiracy to commit crime and aiding of criminal activities. He said the R200 000 worth of goods had been kept in garages of the accused and sometimes would be moved to other places to avoid being found. We had been investigating this case for a long time and we had received information from our informants that the food would be moved to the mines. The food suppliers were allegedly bought through legitimate suppliers and repackaged by wrapping to prevent breakage during drop-down into closed shafts for illegal miners to be sustained for long periods whilst digging, said Nkwalase. He said one of the arrested suspects was a security guard and that they suspects would feel the wrath of the law.
