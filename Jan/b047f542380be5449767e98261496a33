South Africa said it will remain committed to the African agenda at the G20 this year. The group of G20 are expected to put Africa at the top of its agenda for the very first time in the history of its meeting. G20 2017 will take place in Hamburg, Germany. South Africa is expected to put Africa's challenges and partnerships at the top of its discussions, although Germany wants the G20 countries to discuss issues like migration policy, fair trade rules and foreign investment affecting Africa. Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba said they also want the G20 to address the huge youth unemployment facing the continent. "And so we will play our role in terms of partnering with G20 countries to attract investment to the African continent, we ourselves are keen to increase partnerships with the different African countries in infrastructure investments to diversify our economies and increase intra-African trade. And ensure therefore that investments that come from elsewhere in the world into Africa find us as equal partners not as helpless recipient's as the world suggests." Menawhile South Africa picked up second place, coming behind Mauritius who is leading the pack as number one in the 2017 Africa Competitiveness Report which was released during the WEF Africa conference in Durban. Despite lacklustre economic growth, which has remained at less than a percent in the last financial year, South Africa is still seen as second most competitive economy on the continent. This is largely due to the rapid growth and improvement in the services sector. South Africa is the best performer on the continent in the areas of financial market development, technological readiness, business sophistication and innovation, said Barak Daniel Hoffman, co-author of the African Competitiveness report at the World Bank.
