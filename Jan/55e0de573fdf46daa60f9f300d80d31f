The High Court sitting in Phuthaditjhaba Magistrate court slapped a notorious serial killer with a life sentence imprisonment last week.Justice Jamela Joseph Mhlambi on delivering his sentence pointed out that Molefe Johannes Lentsha (34) was guilty in all seven murder charges that he faced. He said Molefe had been dishonest throughout the trial and contradicted himself several times. The court heard that the convicted man raped and killed his victims and buried them in shallow graves. Molefe strangled his victims to death and buried them in shallow graves in Gedult farm in Kestel from 2008 and amongst them was a toddler. Molefe was later arrested in October 2015 in Carltonville in Gauteng where he was hiding after killing his victims. It was revealed in the court that in 2012 Molefe was found in possession of marijuana (dagga) and fined, again in 2013 charged with assault and received punishment to face two months of imprisonment. Spokesperson of National Prosecuting Authority Phaladi Shuping said the prosecution was happy that it convicted the serial killer. We are grateful of the sentence as this shows that our justice system worked very hard to ensure that Letsema gets what he deserved, he said. Shuping said the prosecution would always work hard to put the suspects behind the bars for their bad deeds.
