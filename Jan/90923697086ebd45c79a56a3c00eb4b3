The Holy Survivors Feeding Scheme from Egypt in Bohlokong was started in 2014 by Lebohang Mokoena to alleviate poverty in Bohlokong sections including Phase 7, Egypt and Captain Charles Informal Settlement. Close to 200 children from less privileged households get meals every Thursday from volunteers of the organization. Run by four volunteers, the feeding scheme gets donations from Bethlehem Child and Family Welfare and Debonairs but are not receiving funding from the Department of Social Development. The feeding scheme also helps connect social workers with children that have family problems, helps kids with school homework, assist kids without ID/ birth certificates to get these documents and helps with school uniforms where needed. Bethlehem Child and Family Welfare recently donated 150 mugs to the feeding scheme to help the organization to continue feeding less privileged families as part of their 12 month partnership agreement to help the organization with necessary skills and donations.
